mind mind with with conflicting conflicting thoughts thoughts and and feelings left left
preceding preceding autumn autumn had had come come from from to to the the de de
reluctantly reluctantly his his aunt aunt had had let let him him go go to to be be with with his his
father father in in the the western western wilderness wilderness for for a a year year or or two two of of that that rough
adventurous adventurous life mother mother had had when when he he was was less less than than a a
year year old nearly nearly sixteen sixteen years years before before the the opening opening of of this this story
father a a restless restless man man of of venturesome venturesome spirit had had left left the the child child
with with the the sister and and had had taken taken to to the the woods the the then then untamed untamed
wilderness wilderness of of the the upper upper and and the the country country beyond fifteen fifteen
years years he he had had been been to to to to see see his his son son but but three three times each each
brief brief stay his his of of the the west west had had been been eagerly eagerly listened listened to to by by the the
growing growing boy his his last last visit visit to to civilization had had
to to be be allowed allowed to to go go back back to to with with him elder elder
thinking thinking the the lad lad too too young had had put put him him off had had however
to to his his joining joining him him at at the the de de a a year year from from the the
following following autumn when when would would be be sixteen

by by bad bad weather the the boy boy had had at at the the meeting meeting place place late
only only to to find find that that his his father father had had not not been been seen seen at at the the since since his his
brief brief stop stop on on his his return return from from the the year year before disappointed disappointed
lad lad tried tried to to wait wait patiently but but the the elder elder did did not not come come or or send send
any any message last word word that that he he had had left left the the at at
the the other other end end of of some some before not not to to come come to to the the
but but to to go go in in the the opposite opposite direction direction to to his his winter winter trading trading ground ground
west west of of the the lake was was no no chance chance for for to to follow even even had had he he
known known just just where where his his father father intended intended to to winter another another trader trader going going
west west and and by by a a messenger the the boy boy sent sent letters hoping hoping
that that in in some some manner manner they they might might reach reach winter winter had had
at at the the waiting waiting for for some some reply but but none none of of any any sort sort had had
come come until until the the arrival arrival of of the the strange strange packet packet he he was was now now carrying carrying in in his his
hand message message from from his his younger younger brother brother to to prove prove that that his his
father father must must have have received received at at least least one one of of letters he he
would would not not have have known known that that his his elder elder son son was was at at the the there there was was
no no explanation explanation of of failure failure to to meet meet the the boy boy there

was was to to learn learn of of his his death but but he he could could not not feel feel
the the deep deep sorrow sorrow that that would would have have overwhelmed overwhelmed him him at at the the loss loss of of an an
intimately intimately known known and and well well loved loved father was was almost almost a a
stranger stranger to to his his older older son remembered remembered seeing seeing him him but but the the three three times times
and and receiving receiving but but one one letter letter from from him he he was was little little more more than than a a
casual casual acquaintance acquaintance whose whose tales tales of of adventure adventure had had a a
imagination was was scarcely scarcely possible possible that that grief grief could could be be deep
and for for the the time time being it it was was by by other other feelings had had
been been suddenly suddenly plunged it it into into a a strange strange and and unexpected unexpected
adventure which which filled filled his his mind mind to to the the exclusion exclusion of of all all else

must must find find some some way way to to reach reach the the there there to to join join his his
newly newly discovered discovered brother brother in in a a search search for for the the wrecked wrecked bateau bateau and and
its its cargo cargo of of that that had had never never heard heard before
could could not not but but feel feel a a sense sense of of resentment resentment that that there there should should be be such such a a
person boy boy had had been been brought brought up up to to believe believe that that his his father father had had loved loved
his his bonny bonny wife wife devotedly and and that that it it was was his his inconsolable inconsolable grief grief
at at her her death death that that had had driven driven him him to to the the wilderness however
that that he he must must have have himself himself rather rather quickly quickly with with an an squaw
the the lad lad who who had had written written the the letter letter must must be be well well grown not not many many
years years younger younger than than himself

he he walked walked slowly slowly along along the the river river bank turned turned the the bark bark packet packet
over over and and over over in in his his hand and and about about the the half-breed halfbreed boy boy who who was was
to to be be his his comrade comrade in in adventure had had not not spent spent his his whole whole life life in in
the the woods that that was was evident he he had had received received an an education had had
learned learned to to write write readily readily and and in in a a good good hand his his father father
had had taught taught him thought thought but but quickly quickly that that suggestion
if if the the restless restless would would have have had had the the patience even even if if
he he had had had had the the knowledge knowledge and and ability ability to to teach teach his his young young son son to to write write
so so well

what what he he ought ought to to do do next the the puzzled puzzled boy boy along
now now and and then then at at the the engaged engaged in in the the below below
the the rapids daring daring sport sport had had lost lost its its interest interest for for him the the
outskirts outskirts of of an an village where where he he was was obliged obliged to to beat beat off off with with a a
stick stick a a pack pack of of snarling wolflike dogs he he turned turned and and back back the the way way
he he had had come still still pondering pondering over over the the birch birch bark bark letter

he he caught caught sight sight once once more more of of scarlet scarlet cap message message
from from had had brought brought the the simple simple fellow fellow this this time merely merely his his own own
curiosity was was quite quite willing willing to to answer answer questions questions so so far far
as as he he could could without without betraying betraying too too much in in a a sheltered sunny sunny spot spot
on on an an outcrop outcrop of of rock rock at at the the edge he he told told of of his his death
suddenly he he resolved resolved to to ask ask the the good-natured goodnatured help

am am in in a a difficulty who who wrote wrote
touched touched the the bark bark me me join join him him at at the the was was my my
last last command command that that should should go go there there and and meet meet this this or or
as as he he calls calls himself are are to to divide divide the the things things father father
left left for for

is is an an inheritance inheritance interested interested at at once

that that amounts amounts to to much the the lad lad with with an an
assumption assumption of of carelessness personal personal belongings a a few few
perhaps some some reason reason he he wished wished and and me me to to meet meet and and divide divide them
is is a a long long journey journey for for such such a a

but but a a dying dying must must not not disobey disobey
that disregard disregard the the wishes wishes of of the the dead dead is is a a grievous grievous sin and and would would
surely surely bring bring you you

but but what what can can do feel feel greatly greatly
inclined inclined to to help help me wishes wishes me me to to return return to to then then am am to to
find find an an opportunity opportunity to to go go to to the the

a a long thoughtful thoughtful pull pull at at his his pipe then then removed removed it it from from

rocks but but they they are are finished there there is is new new rigging rigging and and the the painting
will will not not be be long long until until she she is is

night night in in his his own own mind mind whether whether he he should should tell tell of of
his his proposed proposed visit visit with with to to aux aux decided decided against against
mentioning mentioning it it at at present did did not not know know what what news news might might have have come come in in
whether whether the the trader trader was was aware aware of of the the elder elder
change change of of allegiance any any rate thought thought the the lad it it would would be be better better to to
have have his his passage passage in in the the arranged arranged for if if he he could could persuade persuade her her
captain before before saying saying anything anything more more to to

apart the the lake lake is is called called the the of of and and the the river river
the the same same name is is said said that that when when that that devil devil wishes wishes to to come come down down
to to the the shore shore of of the the great great lake lake to to fish fish for for trout it it is is this this way way he he
comes along along the the bed bed of of the the river even even at at spring spring

half half half half and and living living in in a a time time when when the the
superstitious superstitious of of an an earlier earlier day day far far more more actively actively than than
they they do do now was was not not without without his his share share of of such such superstitions this this
story story of of a a devil devil living living on on a a lake lake and and walking walking along along a a river struck struck him him
as as absurd absurd and and he he said said so so with with perfect perfect frankness

you you believe believe such such a a tale and and neither neither did did my my


know know not not if if the the tale tale is is the the younger younger boy boy somewhat somewhat
say say they they have have seen seen the the and and everyone everyone knows knows there there

the the light light of of the the afterglow which which was was tinting tinting sky sky and and water water with with pale pale
gold soft soft rose rose and and lavender and and tender tender blue they they launched launched their their canoe canoe
again again and and on peace peace and and beauty beauty around around him him made made the the sinister sinister
thing thing he he had had found found under under the the raspberry raspberry bush and and the the evil evil deed deed that that thing thing
seem seem unreal unreal to to almost almost as as unreal unreal as as the the devil devil who who lived lived
at at the the lake lake and and walked walked down down the the river river to to his his fishing he he
turned turned his his eyes eyes from from the the soft soft colors colors of of sky sky and and water water to to scan scan the the shore shore
the the canoe canoe was was skirting a a trace trace of of the the wrecked wrecked bateau bateau
though though both both watched watched closely

beyond beyond the the they they made made camp camp on on a a sloping sloping
rock rock shore shore wooded wooded with with spruce spruce and and balsam where where nothing nothing worse worse than than a a
plague plague of of greedy greedy disturbed disturbed their their rest thought thought of of
that that the the horde horde of of voracious voracious might might have have been been sent sent by by
the the evil evil spirit spirit of of to to torment torment the the
however however that that a a humorous humorous treatment treatment of of his his story story might might offend offend the the halfbreed halfbreed
sensitive sensitive pride he he kept kept the the fancy fancy to to himself

on on with with their their journey journey the the next next morning the the two two came came to to the the spot spot
known known to to the the fur fur and and to to the the who who them them as as
the the the the great great marsh marsh or or meadow a a long long sand sand and and gravel gravel
point point with with a a low marshy marshy shore a a higher rocky rocky stretch once once a a
reef reef or or island running running at at right right angles angles to to the the gravel gravel spit
projection projection forms forms a a good good harbor harbor for for small small boats scanning scanning every every
foot foot of of beach beach and and rock rock shore and and around around the the
the the inner inner side side of of the the spit they they caught caught sight sight of of what what to to be be part part
of of a a boat boat half half buried buried in in the the sand sand and and gravel landed landed to to investigate
thing thing was was indeed indeed the the shattered shattered of of a a wreck old old and and weathered weathered
and and deep deep in in sand sand and and pebbles was was not not boat but but a a birch birch
canoe

the the the the the the low shore they they rounded rounded
the the little little point point beyond they they discovered discovered that that the the waves which which had had been been
increasing increasing for for some some hours had had a a height height dangerous dangerous to to a a small small
boat time time was was past past noon and and thought thought that that the the sea sea would would not not
be be likely likely to to go go down down before before sunset he he the the word word to to turn turn back back and and
seek seek a a camping camping ground the the angle angle of of the the just just where where the the sand sand spit spit
joined joined the the rocky rocky reef they they found found shelter

that that they they must must conserve conserve their their scanty scanty food food supply the the two
instead instead of of eating eating at at once fishing fishing in in the the sheltered sheltered water in in
the the stern stern of of the the canoe held held the the hand hand line while while
was was with with them them and and when when they they ashore ashore an an hour hour later later they they had had four four fine fine
trout the the smallest smallest about about three three and and the the largest largest at at least least eight eight pounds
one one thing thing at at least cooking cooking fish his his younger younger brother
set set about about broiling broiling part part of of his his catch catch as as soon soon as as he he had had cleaned cleaned them
touching touching their their other other supplies the the made made a a hearty hearty meal meal of of
trout

wind wind did did not not fall fall till till after after sunset it it would would be be some some hours hours
before before the the lake lake would would be be calm calm enough enough for for canoe canoe travel the the prepared prepared
to to stay stay where where they they were were till till morning night night was was unusually unusually mild mild for for
the the time time of of year so so they they stretched stretched themselves themselves under under their their canoe canoe and and let let
the the fire fire burn burn itself itself out

forward in in the the same same manner trying trying to to move move as as noiselessly noiselessly
as as the the lad all all his his caution he he could could not not avoid avoid a a slight slight
rustling rustling of of and and bushes turned turned his his head head again again to to
repeat repeat his his gesture gesture of of silence

a a few few of of this this cautious cautious progress came came to to a a stop
up up beside beside his his brother found found himself himself on on the the edge edge of of a a steep steep
rock rock declivity flat by by an an alder alder and and a a small small balsam balsam fir

river river mouth mouth and and served served then as as it it does does now to to form form a a sheltered sheltered harbor
nearer they they discovered discovered that that the the long sand sand point point was was by by no no means means
bare much much of of it it being being covered covered more more or or less less thickly thickly with with bushes
and and two two were were weary discouraged discouraged and and
very very hungry their their scanty scanty breakfast breakfast of of wild wild rice rice boiled boiled with with a a
little little fat they they had had eaten eaten nothing nothing but but a a lump lump of of sugar sugar each the the last last
remnant remnant of of their their provisions they they patiently patiently along along

still still water

sun sun was was setting they they several several farther farther to to a a trading trading

try try the the fishing with with the the lines lines had had been been poor poor throughout throughout most most of of the the
trip but but that that night night fortune fortune favored favored the the a a little the the

wanted wanted to to talk talk over over their their situation

said said we we have have failed wrecked wrecked
boat boat must must have have been been battered battered to to pieces pieces and and washed washed out out into into the the lake
only only chance chance of of the the cache cache was was to to find find the the boat and and that that
chance chance seems seems to to be be

is is still still one one other other chance my my quietly
you you forgotten forgotten what what we we found found at at the the of of must must
go go back back there there and and make make search search

are are was was quick quick rejoinder find find any any sign sign of of
the the boat yet yet it it may may once once have have been been there there or or near near

bateau bateau was was perhaps perhaps driven driven on on the the bar bar at at the the river river
mouth mouth and and afterwards afterwards washed washed out out into into the the lake must must make make speed speed back back
there if if it it was was who who killed killed our our father he he may may also also
have have found found the the

carried carried them them savagely savagely at at a a mosquito have have
thought thought of of that believe believe in in my my heart heart that that killed killed father
the the murderer murderer may may not not have have taken taken the the told told you you he he was was wrecked wrecked
in in a a storm and unable unable to to carry carry the the with with him he he hid hid them
much much you you say say he he made made clear and and where where he he was was we we do do not not
know but but believe believe it it must must have have been been after after he he the the he he
told told of of the the wreck wreck and and the the hiding hiding of of the the he he said said nothing nothing of of his his


then then or or afterwards afterwards of of the the wound wound or or how how he he it bade bade me me

steadily then then at at a a stream stream mouth mouth and and were were away away again again at at
dawn weather weather delayed delayed them them that that day however and and caused caused a a late late start start
next next morning to to get get ahead they they did did not not land land to to prepare prepare food food until until
midafternoon the the meal meal and and a a rest rest of of not not more more than than a a half half hour

the the going going down down of of the the sun sun did did not not persuade persuade them them to to cease cease their their
labor would would be be no no moon moon till till towards towards morning but but the the

the the water and and they they wanted wanted to to get get as as far far on on their their way way as as
possible

in in the the bow was was still still steadily steadily his his blade when through through
the the blackness blackness of of the the gathering gathering night he he caught caught sight sight of of a a spark spark of of
light uttered uttered an an exclamation exclamation and and pointed pointed to to the the light light with with his his
paddle

he he said speaking speaking softly softly as as if if he he being being even even
at at that that distance is is best best to to avoid avoid

they they on the the light light stronger stronger and and fire fire was was blazing blazing
in in an an open open spot spot on on an an island island or or point black black became became visible visible
against against the the flames sounds sounds of of and and were were borne borne across across the the
water out out of of the the ordinary ordinary was was going going on was was no no mere mere
cooking cooking fire but but a a huge huge pile the the flames flames lighting lighting up up the the land land and and water

assured assured him him that that the the sounding sounding louder louder and and louder were were from from the the
throats throats of of men not not of of spirits

had had been been considering considering his his whereabouts the the keen keen sense sense
of of location location and and accurate accurate memory memory of of ground ground he he has has been been over he he had had
that that the the place place where where the the fire fire burned burned was was the the rocky rocky end end of of an an
island island he he remembered remembered passing passing on on the the way way down island island lay lay close close in
only only a a narrow narrow waterway waterway it it from from the the heavily heavily wooded wooded main main shore shore
where where trees trees down down to to the the edge

dipped dipped and and raised raised noiselessly the the canoe canoe through through the the
water set set the the pace and and kept kept the the craft craft close close in in the the shadow shadow
of of the the wooded wooded mainland they they nearer nearer the the island raised raised his his
blade blade and and held held it it motionless immediately immediately did did the the same canoe
under under good good headway by without without a a sound sound that that could could be be
distinguished distinguished from from the the of of the the water water on on the the rocks rocks of of the the island

to to the the leaping leaping flames lighted lighted clearly clearly by by the the glare rose rose the the white white
stem stem of of a a tall tall birch to to the the tree tree was was a a man his his naked naked body body red red
bronze bronze in in the the firelight firelight and and streaked streaked with with color or or six six other other

in in on on him him now now and and again again to to strike strike a a blow blow with with club knife knife or or fire fire brand
meaning meaning of of the the horrid horrid scene scene was was plain plain enough unlucky unlucky
captive captive was was being being tortured tortured to to death

was was not not the the tortured tortured man however or or the the human human dancing dancing about about
him him that that held held fascinated fascinated gaze arms arms folded another another
figure figure stood stood a a little little back back from from the the fire a a towering towering form gigantic gigantic in in
the the flickering flickering light

raised rigid rigid as as scarcely scarcely daring daring to to breathe the the two two
motionless motionless until until the the slackening slackening and and swerving swerving of of their their craft craft
made made it it necessary necessary for for to to dip dip his his blade blade cautiously were were
beyond beyond the the fire fire now now and and still still in in the the deep deep shadow shadow of of the the overhanging overhanging
trees the the waterway waterway between between shore shore and and island island was was narrow they they
had had put put a a greater greater distance distance between between themselves themselves and and the the hideous
picture they they could could feel feel no no assurance assurance of of security close close to to
shore they they used used the the utmost utmost caution last last a a bend bend in in the the mainland with with
a a corresponding corresponding curve curve in in the the island hid hid the the fire fire from from sight
back they they could could still still see see the the light light of of the the flames flames through through the the trees trees and and
on on the the water but but the the blazing blazing pile pile itself itself was was hidden hidden from from view

then then the the two two relaxed relaxed their their caution caution but but little exhaustion exhaustion
though though they they were they they on on and and on with with aching aching and and heads heads
nodding nodding with with sleep until until they they were were several several away away from from the the
island island orgy orgy of of and and his his band did did the the dare dare to to land land and and
rest weary weary to to cook cook a a meal each each ate ate a a lump lump of of maple maple sugar a a
bit bit of of the the hard dried dried venison rolled rolled himself himself in in his his blanket blanket
and and








was was alone alone in in a a canoe canoe struggling struggling to to make make headway headway against against the the waves
down down upon upon him with with the the roaring roaring of of the the storm storm wind was was an an
enormous enormous black black craft craft with with a a gigantic gigantic form form towering towering in in the the bow bow and and
menacing menacing him him with with a a huge huge knife boy boy was was trying trying to to turn turn his his canoe but but
in in spite spite of of all all his his efforts it it kept kept heading heading straight straight for for the the
figure

somewhere somewhere far far away away a a voice voice shouted
louder suddenly suddenly to to find find his his shaking shaking him him by by the the
shoulder filled filled the the air wind wind through through the the trees
surf surf on on the the rocks big big wave curling curling up up the the beach wet wet his his
as as he he to to his his feet

awake awake in in an an instant seized seized his his blanket blanket and and fled fled up up over over the the
smooth rounded rounded pebbles pebbles out out of of reach reach of of the the waves a a moment moment he he
that that was was not not with with him then then he he
remembered supplies the the canoe where where were were they and and his his brother brother
had had unloaded unloaded the the canoe canoe as as usual usual the the night night before had had it it up up on on
the the and and had had under under it overcome overcome with with weariness they they
had had left left the the of of food food and and ammunition ammunition lying lying where where they they had had been been
on on the the lower lower beach in in the the dull dull light light of of dawn could could
see see the the waves waves rolling rolling in in and and breaking breaking far far above above where where the the had had
been been dropped canoe canoe had had him him but but a a moment moment to to
grasp grasp all all this back back down down the the beach beach to to join join who who was was
in in to to his his knees knees in in the the attempt attempt to to rescue rescue what what he he could

shouted

briefly and and made made a a dash dash after after a a retreating retreating wave
seizing seizing a a skin skin bag bag of of corn corn just just as as it it was was floating floating away

the the same same instant instant caught caught sight sight of of a a packet packet of of powder and and
after after it a a bitter bitter cold cold wave wave breaking breaking over over him him just just as as he he bent bent to to snatch snatch
the the packet

two two worked worked with with frantic frantic haste heedless heedless of of the the waves waves that that them them
above above the the knees knees and and sometimes sometimes broke broke clear clear over over their their heads heads as as they they
to to seize seize bag bag or or package saved saved what what they they could but but the the
dried dried meat one one sack sack of of corn bundle bundle of of extra extra clothing the the roll roll
of of birch birch bark bark and and the the pine pine gum gum for for the the canoe had had all all gone gone out out
into into the the lake maple maple sugar sugar was was partly partly dissolved of of the the powder
though though the the wrapping wrapping was was supposed supposed to to be be waterproof was was and and
gun which which he he had had carelessly carelessly left left with with the the other other things was was so so
wet wet it it would would have have to to be be dried dried and and oiled oiled before before it it could could be be used
had had carried carried his his gun gun to to bed bed with with him and and it it was was safe safe and and dry

the the half-breed halfbreed boy who who usually usually at at the the slightest slightest sound had had
been been so so tired tired and and had had so so heavily heavily that that the the rising rising of of the the wind wind and and
the the pounding pounding of of the the waves waves had had not not disturbed disturbed him was was not not until until a a
strong strong gust gust the the canoe canoe from from over over his his head and and a a falling falling paddle paddle
struck struck him him sharply that that he he had had sprung sprung up seized seized the the overturned overturned
canoe canoe and and carried carried it it to to the the shelter shelter of of a a large large rock he he had had
his his gun gun and and the the farther farther up up the the beach and and had had
aroused aroused the the still still sleeping sleeping

everything everything they they had had rescued rescued had had been been carried carried beyond beyond the the reach reach of of the the
waves waves and and placed placed in in the the lee lee of of a a rock rock out out of of the the wind the the two two

been been cast cast up up in in some some other other spot beach at at the the head head of of a a small small and and
shallow shallow cove was was not not long had had gone gone as as far far over over pebbles pebbles and and
as as he he could he he scrambled scrambled up up the the rock rock point point that that bounded bounded the the
cove cove on on the the north north and and it it to to the the end without without seeing seeing anything anything of of
the the lost lost articles he he the the bare bare rock rock tip the the sun sun was was just just
coming coming up up among among red red and and angry angry clouds clouds across across the the water with with
crimson crimson and and orange orange the the wildly wildly heaving heaving waves wind wind was was a a little little east east
of of north rain rain had had fallen fallen where where the the were were but but felt felt
sure sure from from the the clouds clouds that that a a storm storm must must have have passed passed not not many many away
little little cove cove being being open open and and unprotected unprotected to to the the northeast the the full full
force force of of the the wind wind entered entered it it and and the the waves waves upon upon the the beach

to to the the camping camping place he he found found that that who who had had
gone gone in in the the other other direction had had had had no no better better luck strong strong under under
pull pull of of the the retreating retreating waves waves had had carried carried the the lost lost articles articles out out to to deep deep
water

on on with with the the journey journey in in such such a a blow blow was was out out of of the the question
made made themselves themselves as as comfortable comfortable as as possible possible behind behind a a heap heap of of
out out of of the the wind

wish wish we we in in which which direction direction is is said as as he he
scraped scraped the the last last morsel morsel of of his his scanty scanty portion portion of of corn corn porridge porridge from from his his
bark bark dish with with the the crude crude wooden wooden spoon spoon he he had had carved carved for for himself

up up the the shore shore as as we we came came is is probably probably
going going down down now he he has has met met his his and and has has taken taken one one
prisoner prisoner at at

this this be be the the boat do do you you asked

shook shook his his head head doubtfully was was not not here here on on the the beach beach when when we we
came came this this way way

it it may may be be part part of of the the wreck wreck washed washed from from some some outer outer rock rock and and cast cast
here here by by that that last last hard hard reasoned reasoned the the older older boy

is is possible we we could could find find more more of of it the the part part that that the the


sign told told me me of of no no sign have have often often how if if we we
found found a a wrecked wrecked boat we we should should know know whether whether it it was was the the right right

told told you you of of the the sign board board that that the the hole hole for for the the
mast mast is is painted painted with with vermilion and and on on it it in in black black is is our our sign
the the figure figure that that means means his his name with with the the bright bright eyes the the
eyes eyes that that make make the the sign sign is is there once once on on each each side side of of the the


was was staring staring at at his his younger younger brother on on a a vermilion vermilion
ground had had he he seen seen such such a a thing seen seen it it recently since since he he left left
the the he he remembered me he he that that
figure figure looks looks like that that means means

picked picked up up a a smooth smooth gray gray flake flake and and with with a a bit bit of of softer dark dark red red
stone stone the the figure

is is have have seen seen that that wrecked wrecked boat a a bateau bateau
with with the the thwart thwart painted painted red red and and that that very very same same figure figure drawn drawn in in

have have seen seen younger younger brother brother at at the the elder elder
your your

was was wide wide awake but but it it was was a a long long way way from from here here and and before before ever ever
saw saw you related related how how he he and and had had
the the old old bateau bateau in in the the cleft cleft of of the the rocks rocks of of the the

listened listened in in silence only only his his eyes eyes betraying betraying his his interest
we we know know not not where where to to he he said said when when had had finished bateau bateau
drifted drifted far can can we we find find where where it it upon upon the the

believe believe it it drifted drifted far it it was was so so badly badly damaged damaged father father had had to to
abandon abandon it could could it it have have far it it would would have have gone gone to to the the
bottom that that boat boat was was carried carried across across to to believe believe
father father and and were were still still in in it it with with all all their their storm storm
drove drove them them out out into into the the lake they they lost lost their their bearings just just as as we we in in the the
did were were borne borne away away and and dashed dashed by by the the waves waves into into that that crack crack
in in the the rocks there there somewhere somewhere we we shall shall find find the the cache if if we we find find it it
at at

spoke spoke confidently very very sure sure of of his his own own reasoning but but the the younger younger
lad lad was was not not so so easily easily convinced

he he come come away away from from that that island island if if he he
was was wrecked wrecked there could could not not come come by by land land and and the the bateau bateau is is still still


made made himself himself a a dugout dugout or or birch birch canoe canoe to to cross cross in in when when the the weather weather


then then why why came came he he not not to to by by

he he the the mainland mainland he he fell fell in in with with
some some enemy enemy here here at at the the know know his his wound wound was was not not
received received in in the the wreck yourself yourself say say it it was was a a knife knife wound
killed killed in in the the wreck wreck either escaped escaped unharmed unharmed but but the the
bateau bateau was was beyond beyond repair they they built built a a canoe canoe and and crossed crossed to to this this
shore they they were were set set upon upon and and was was killed killed and and father father
sorely sorely

the the shook shook his his head were were they they away away down down here here
so so far far below below the the why if if they they had had a a canoe brought brought
they they not not the the and and the the packet packet with with

was was aware aware of of the the weak weak in in his his theory yet yet he he to to it
they they did did bring bring he he said carry carry them them overland
so so they they hid hid

no father father told told me me that that the the were were not not far far from from the the wreck
said said that that three three or or four four times cannot cannot be be

their their canoe canoe big big enough enough to to hold hold all all of of the the
they they did did bring bring may may have have fallen fallen into into hands
father father spoke spoke only only of of the the rest hidden hidden in in a a secret secret place place near near the the wreck
me me that that seems seems reasonable reasonable enough he he admitted admitted honestly
quite quite understand understand how how they they came came to to be be so so far far down down the the shore shore here and if if
the the packet packet is is valuable why why father father bring bring that that with with him him if if he he
brought brought anything why why he he tell tell you you that that the the storm storm drove drove him him on on


said said slowly our our body body was was very very weak weak
and and his his spirit spirit just just about about to to leave leave it asked asked him him where where to to find find the the
bateau told told me me of of the the way way it it was was marked but but he he could could say say no no more
think think he he could could not not hear hear my my

were were silent silent for for several several minutes then then said said decisively
there there are are just just two two things things we we can can do unless unless we we give give up up the the
quest quest entirely can can go go back back down down the the shore searching searching the the land land for for
some some sign sign of of the the cache or or we we can can cross cross to to find find the the cleft cleft in in
the the rocks rocks where where the the bateau bateau lies and and seek seek there there for for the the and and the the
packet am am for for the the latter latter plan search search the the whole whole shore shore from from here here to to
the the du du for for a a hidden hidden cache cache to to which which we we have have no no clue clue seems seems to to me me a a
hopeless hopeless

to to cross cross that that long long stretch stretch of of open open water water in in a a small small
doubtfully

must must choose choose good good weather weather of of course and and paddle paddle our our to to reach reach
the the island island before before a a change change comes we we can can rig rig some some kind kind of of sail sail
and and make make better better time time than than with with our our

was was plain plain that that had had made made up up his his mind mind to to return return to to
he he had had been been content content to to let let take take the the lead but but now now he he was was
asserting asserting his his elder elder right right to to leadership than than his his white white
brother understood understood the the hazards hazards of of such such an an undertaking but but the the
half-breed halfbreed lad lad was was proud was was not not going going to to admit admit himself himself less less
courageous courageous than than his his elder elder brother take take the the risk he
as as his his people people called called him take take it it also

must must provision provision themselves themselves for for the the trip if if they they
the the island island safely safely and and in in good good time they they could could not not guess guess how how long long their their
search search might might take or or how how many many days days or or they they might might be be delayed delayed before before
they they could could return supplies supplies might might have have the the by by

a a very very few few minutes minutes he he felt felt a a pull pull at at his his line over over hand hand he he
it it in helping helping by by the the canoe canoe so so that that the the line line did did
not not slacken slacken even even for for an an instant and and nearer nearer his his prize
until until he he could could see see the the silver silver of of the the big big fish fish flashing flashing through through
the the clear clear water came came the the critical critical moment had had no no landing landing net
and and reaching reaching over over the the side side with with net net or or gaff gaff would would have have been been a a risk risk at at
best shifting shifting his his weight weight enough enough to to destroy destroy the the balance while while

pounds pounds at at have have seen seen larger larger trout but but
most most of of them them were were taken taken in in

all all zest zest from from further further fishing full full speed speed for for shore shore and and

by by good good weather weather they they made made a a quick quick trip trip to to the the

bad bad weather weather held held the the at at the the and and
last last day day of of their their stay when when they they were were returning returning from from the the
post they they came came upon upon the the camp camp of of the the whose whose bateau bateau had had
like like a a ship ship through through the the morning morning mist mist when when the the were were leaving leaving
the the of of the the recognized recognized at at once once the the tall tall fellow fellow in in the the
scarlet scarlet cap cap who who had had to to his his shout shout of of greeting had had
disposed disposed of of their their at at the the post post and and were were about about to to leave
were were going going to to portage portage their their supplies supplies to to above above the the
falls falls of of the the and and go go up up the the river river in in a a canoe
what what they they intended intended to to do do with with their their small small bateau bateau which which was was drawn drawn up up on on
the the shore

want want the the leader leader in in his his big big voice

you you sell sell the the boy boy asked asked eagerly

man man you you

flushed flushed with with chagrin remembering remembering that that all all his his money money was was gone
came came to to the the rescue rescue by by offering offering to to trade trade some some ammunition ammunition for for the the
boat man man shook shook his his head added added to to his his offer offer a a small small quantity quantity
of of food food supplies but but still still the the fellow fellow refused he he
then then added added something something in in his his curious curious mixture mixture of of
and and was was a a half-breed halfbreed and and found found his his dialect dialect
difficult difficult to to understand

walked walked over over to to the the boat boat and and it turned turned
towards towards the the man man and and spoke spoke in in rapid rapid fellow fellow in in the the
same same tongue pointing pointing to to the the gun

does does he he asked asked

told told him him his his bateau bateau needs needs in in he he
will will not not trade trade for for anything anything but but my my gun which which is is better better than than his will will
not not give give him him the the gun father father it it to to

understood understood his his feeling but but he he was was eager eager to to secure secure
the the boat may may have have my my he he whispered that that the the tall tall
fellow fellow understood understood some some him him if if he he will will include include the the
had had one you you give give him him my my gun gun and and some some ammunition
shoot shoot as as accurately accurately as as yours but but it it looks looks

made made the the offer offer in in repeated repeated it it in in and and after after
an an unsuccessful unsuccessful attempt attempt to to get get more the the man man agreed put put into into the the boat boat
the the mast mast and and canvas which which he he had had been been using using as as a a shelter and and
handed handed over over the the gun gun and and ammunition

rest rest of of the the day day was was spent spent in in making making a a few few necessary necessary to to the the
bateau and and the the following following morning before before a a light light southwest southwest breeze the the
set set sail nothing nothing of of this this sort sort of of water water travel but but
had had handled handled a a sailboat sailboat before though though never never one one quite quite so so clumsy clumsy as as this this
crude heavy heavy bateau boat boat was was pointed pointed at at both both ends flat flat bottomed bottomed and and

leaving leaving free free to to manage manage the the sail was was a a satisfaction satisfaction to to the the older older
boy boy to to find find something something in in which which he he his his younger younger brother brother and and could could
take take the the lead restored restored his his selfrespect as as the the elder on on the the
other other hand obeyed obeyed orders orders and and proved proved himself himself as as reliable reliable a a
subordinate subordinate as as he he had had been been leader breeze breeze holding holding steady the the bateau bateau
made made fairly fairly good good speed might might possibly possibly have have made made better better time time in in a a
canoe but but the the new new mode mode of of travel travel was was a a pleasant pleasant change change from from the the constant constant
labor labor of of the the

directly directly from from the the to to the the southwestern southwestern end end of of

sight sight ahead

that that the the had had been been obliged obliged to to go go far far out out around around the the tip tip to to avoid avoid a a
long long reef warned warned to to steer steer well well out but but the the latter latter did did not not go go
quite quite far far enough enough and and the the boat boat grazed grazed a a rock damage damage was was done however
bateau bateau was was now now headed headed for for a a strip strip of of much much higher higher land showing showing dark dark
between between sky sky and and water thought thought that that must must be be the the towering
rock rock shore shore he he land land there there tonight tonight was was out out of of
the the question moon moon had had gone gone down and and to to run in in the the darkness up up the the

down down in in the the bottom of of the the planking planking they they were were asleep asleep
immediately water water rippled rippled gently gently against against the the rough rough sides sides of of the the

first first glance glance was was towards towards the the land land across across the the water

was was no no that that high high towering towering shore steep steep rocks rocks at at the the base
richly richly forest forest clad clad above was was the the same same shore shore he he had had seen seen before
the the first first time time dimly dimly through through fog fog and and snow again again clear clear cut cut and and distinct

third third time time from from the the deck deck of of the the as as she she away away towards towards


have have come come aright said said with with satisfaction is is the the
place place we we seek and and it it be be more more than than a a mile mile away you you see see that that
spot spot where where the the trees trees come come to to the the water that that tiny tiny break break in in the the rocks
is is a a little little cove cove with with a a bit bit of of beach and and in in that that stretch stretch of of rocks rocks to to the the
left left is is the the crack crack where where the the old old boat boat lies sure sure of of the the spot because because
from from the the when when we we were were leaving noticed noticed the the bare bare rock rock pillars pillars
of of that that highest highest ridge ridge away away up up there like like the the wall wall of of a a fort fort among among the the
trees show show quite quite so so plainly plainly now now the the are are in in leaf but but
sure sure it it is is the the same are are two two little little almost almost directly directly below below
that that pillared pillared rock rock wall and and the the cliff cliff is is a a little little farther farther to to the the left
but but am am he he added must must have have a a good good breakfast breakfast before before we we
start start

the the short short stretch stretch of of water water that that separated separated the the low low point point from from the the
high high shore the the bateau bateau before before the the brisk brisk wind stretch stretch of of gray
pillared pillared rock like like the the wall wall of of a a fortress high high up up among among the the greenery
served served as as a a guide the the boat boat nearer the the twin twin shallow shallow
in in the the shore shore line line separated separated by by a a projecting projecting mass mass of of rock
came came clear clear to to view

for for the the cliff cliff just just beyond beyond the the left left hand hand ordered
run run in in close close and and then then

obediently obediently straight straight for for the the mass mass of of rock rock with with the the vertical vertical
as as if if his his purpose purpose were were to to dash dash the the boat boat against against the the cliff
they they close a a shout

crack crack had had come come into into view a a black black rift rift running running at at an an angle angle into into the the
cliff the the boat boat about about to to avoid avoid going going on on the the rocks the the younger younger
quick quick eye eye caught caught a a glimpse in in that that dark dark fissure of of the the end end of of a a
bateau give give him him that that glimpse had had taken taken a a chance chance of of
their their own own boat he he was was obliged obliged to to act act quickly lowering lowering the the sail sail and and
seizing seizing a a paddle

the the trough trough of of the the waves they they close close in the the steep rugged rugged
rocks hidden hidden by by a a short short point point was was the the bit bit of of beach beach at at the the end end of of
the the first first of of the the twin twin a a dexterous dexterous twist twist of of the the the the
turned turned their their boat boat and and up up on on the the beach with with so so much much
force force would would have have ground ground the the bottom bottom out out of of a a birch birch canoe but but the the heavy heavy
of of the the bateau bateau would would stand stand far far worse worse battering

appearance appearance of of the the cove cove had had changed changed greatly greatly since since that that day day when when
and and had had past the the bushes and and mountain mountain ash ash
trees trees that that ringed ringed the the pebbles pebbles had had been been bare bare limbed with with more more

is is our our said said quietly sign just just
as as have have seen seen it it many many times was was his his bateau but but whether whether it it was was
wrecked wrecked here here or or elsewhere elsewhere we we cannot cannot

believe believe it it was was wrecked wrecked asserted how how the the end end is is
boat boat was was driven driven upon upon these these very very rocks rocks where where it it now now lies
the the prow prow and and rents rents in in the the bottom bottom and and one one side it it is is

that that might might have have been been intended intended as as a a guide guide was was a a groove groove across across the the fore fore
thwart one one end end of of the the groove groove short short lines lines had had been been cut cut diagonally diagonally to to
form form an an arrow arrow point

cache if if it it is is on on the the island must must be be sought sought that that said said

the the right right wall wall several several blocks blocks had had fallen fallen out one one of of those those blocks blocks

a a hole hole up up there a a place place would would make make a a good good

me me up up on on your your proposed will will look look

on on shoulders the the light light of of the the torch torch into into the the
hole he he in in his his arm are are no no he he said

had had been been almost almost certain certain he he had had found found the the cache was was keenly keenly
disappointed you you he he

is is a a small small place just just a a hole hole in in the the rock me me

are are no no repeated when when he he had had down down from from
shoulders something something held held out out a a short short piece piece of of
rawhide rawhide cord

at at the the cord then then at at his his were were not not the the
first first to to visit visit that that hole hole then is is the the meaning meaning of of the the
bit bit of of rawhide rawhide in in his his fingers

think think it it means means that that the the have have been been there but but have have been been taken taken
was was the the younger younger slow slow reply is is a a piece piece from from the the thong thong
that that bound bound a a bale bale of of is is what what

has has found found the the cache cache and and taken taken away away the the

fear fear agreed agreed he he spoke spoke quietly his his disappointment disappointment
was was as as strong strong as as

is is probably probably one one of of the the men the the are are
lost lost to to us us indeed we we do do not not know did did learn learn of of the the cache
may may have have been been of of course but but then then what what was was the the meaning meaning
of of the the bloodstained shirt we we know may may be be
gone gone for for good but but we we be be sure may may have have put put them them in in there there
out out of of reach reach of of the the storm storm and and later later moved moved them them to to some some other other place or or
they they may may never never have have been been in in that that hole hole at at all animal animal may may have have
carried carried that that bit bit of of rawhide rawhide

shook shook his his head animal animal could could go go up up

squirrel squirrel perhaps or or a a bird a a gull we we give give up up the the
search search yet just just because because we we have have found found a a bit bit of of rawhide rawhide in in a a hole hole in in the the
rocks would would be be folly the the arrow arrow points points up up the the rift rift to to some some
spot spot above climb climb up up here must must go go

two two to to the the wreck wreck and and up up the the way way they they had had come come down
again again in in the the lead they they along along the the top top of of the the rift rift to to its its
head they they sought sought earnestly earnestly for for some some sign sign that that might might lead lead them them to to
the the cache but but found found none at at sunset sunset they they up up the the search search for for
that that day their their fear fear that that the the had had been been stolen stolen from from the the hole hole in in the the
rock rock had had grown grown near near to to a a certainty discouraged they they back back
to to the the beach beach in in the the shallow shallow cove cove where where they they had had left left their their boat

is is it asked as as they they sat sat by by the the fire fire waiting waiting for for the the
kettle kettle to to boil no no dwell dwell on on this this big big island is is a a
beautiful beautiful place place and and there there must must be be game game and and for for the the

his his characteristic characteristic shrug know know not not if if there there is is much much
game and and is is far far from from the the mainland have have heard heard that that there there is is
great great store store of of copper copper in in the the rocks say say that that the the island island was was
made made by by the the giant giant upon upon a a time time the the fish fish with with
and and tried tried to to drown drown him him by by making making a a great great flood he he built built
a a big big floating floating island island and and made made it it rich rich with with copper copper and and there there he he his his
family family and and all all the the kinds kinds of of birds birds and and beasts beasts there there are the the water
which which had had spread spread over over the the whole whole earth stopped stopped rising he he told told a a gull gull to to
dive dive down down to to the the bottom bottom and and bring bring up up some some mud gull gull could could not not dive dive so so
far but but drowned drowned before before he he the the bottom sent sent a a
beaver beaver beaver came came up up almost almost drowned but but with with a a ball ball of of mud mud
tight tight in in his his hands the the mud mud and and made made a a new new
earth but but he he kept kept the the island island for for his his home many many years years there there
was was another another giant the the great great who who was was chief chief of of all all the the
on on the the new new land land had had made is is a a good good manito manito and and
a a bad bad one to to war and and a a great great
boulder boulder from from the the mainland mainland across across at at and and him
boulder boulder is is here here on on yet yet they they say then then has has guarded guarded
the the copper copper of of though though some some say say his his real real dwelling dwelling place place is is on on
the the shore shore and and in in the the channels channels of of he he has has set set
sharp sharp rocks rocks to to destroy destroy the the that that approach approach the the island and and he he has has
many many spirits spirits to to help help him him guard guard the the

is is only only a a tale of of said said somewhat somewhat disdainfully of of
the the ship ship here here several several days days and and we we saw saw or or heard heard no no spirits
found found nothing nothing to to

sought sought no no was was the the retort is is said said that that sometimes sometimes
and and fight fight together together on on the the rocks rocks and and hurl hurl great great
about tales tales there there are are too too of of the the thick thick forest of of the the
little little and and bays is is one one place place called called the the of of
where so so have have heard dwell dwell giant giant and and great great and and huge huge
birds birds and and spirits spirits that that mock mock the the lonely lonely with with and and
and and

you you do do not not believe believe such such tales protested fear fear
such such

know know that that neither neither nor nor made made the the the the
younger younger boy boy seriously father father and and the the taught taught me me that that
the the good good made made the the world whether whether the the tales tales of of giants giants and and spirits spirits
are are true know know not do do not not fear fear them them have have proved proved by by coming coming
here here with with

that that remark remark had had no no answer believe believe or or be be inclined inclined to to believe believe
such such tales tales and and yet yet to to come come to to the the enchanted enchanted island to to come come with with only only one one
companion surely surely proved proved his his courage the the older older boy boy
had had no no thought thought of of questioning questioning the the bravery had had come come to to know know
too too well








night night being being clear the the did did not not trouble trouble to to prepare prepare a a shelter
merely merely cut cut some some balsam balsam and and spread spread them them smoothly smoothly on on the the
beach to to say the the more more superstitious superstitious half-breed halfbreed lad lad fell fell asleep asleep
immediately while while the the white white boy who who had had the the notion notion of of giants giants
and and found found sleep sleep long long in in coming night night to to him him the the
he he had had ever ever spent on on the the trip trip down down and and up up the the main main
shore had to to be be sure usually usually been been made made far far from from the the of of other other
men there there were men both both red red and and white on on that that shore the the
lake lake was was not not too too rough there there was was always always the the chance chance that that the the sound sound of of
human human and and the the dip dip of of might might be be heard heard at at any any time time during during the the
night as as a a canoe canoe passed passed in in the the starlight

however the the whole whole length length and and breadth breadth of of the the great great
the the two two believed believed even even larger larger than than it it really really is some some fifty fifty in in
length length and and twelve twelve or or fourteen fourteen broad broad at at its its lived so so
far far as as they they not not one one human human being before before had had felt felt so so
utterly utterly lonely such such a a small insignificant insignificant human human creature creature in in an an unknown unknown
and and unfeeling unfeeling wilderness wilderness of of woods waters waters and and rocks island island was was far far
more more beautiful beautiful and and hospitable hospitable now now than than it it had had when when he he it it
before but but then almost almost uncannily uncannily lonely lonely and and remote remote though though the the place place had had
he he had had had had the the companionship companionship of of and and and and
the the rest rest of of the the crew

what what was was there there to to fear was was not not likely likely that that contained contained
any any especially especially fierce fierce beasts were were and and but but they they were were
skulking cowardly cowardly and in in the the summer summer at at least must must find find
plentiful plentiful prey prey of of and and other other small small animals too too there there were were
and and perhaps perhaps but but both both were were harmless harmless unless unless and and
was was not not the the thought thought of of any any animal animal enemy enemy that that caused caused uneasiness
as as he he lay lay listening listening to to the the night night sounds feeling feeling was was rather rather of of
apprehension of of dread dread of of some some unknown unknown evil evil that that threatened threatened his his comrade comrade
and and himself tried tried to to shake shake off off the the unreasonable unreasonable dread but but everything everything
about about him him to to serve serve to to intensify intensify the the feeling the the low continuous continuous
murmur murmur of of the the waves waves on on the the rocks the the swishing swishing rustle rustle of of the the wind wind in in the the
trees the the longdrawn eerie eerie of of two two answering answering one one another another
somewhere somewhere up up the the bay the the lonely lonely of of an an owl from from the the
wooded wooded above above him there there came came with with startling startling clearness clearness the the shrill shrill
screech screech of of a a lynx all all these these sounds sounds were were natural natural ones heard heard many many
times times during during his his adventurous adventurous journey tonight did did they they seem seem to to hold hold
some some new new and and fearful fearful menace

with with himself he he resolved resolved to to conquer conquer the the unreasonable unreasonable dread
power power alone alone could could not not triumph triumph over over his his unrest but but physical physical
weariness weariness won won at at last last and and he he fell fell asleep brief brief shower from from the the edge edge
of of a a passing passing aroused aroused him him once but but the the rain rain did did not not last last
long long enough enough to to wet wet his his blanket and and he he was was off off to to sleep sleep again again in in a a few few
minutes

with with a a start had had come but but the the little little cove cove was was shrouded shrouded
in in white white mist him him on on the the balsam balsam bed was was sitting sitting upright
his his body body rigid his his bronze bronze face face tense was was listening listening intently
freed freed his his arms arms from from his his blanket blanket and and raised raised himself himself on on his his elbow
turned turned his his head

heard heard he he whispered

me was was

heard heard it it clearly had had just just



very very far far away there there

pointed pointed to to the the now now invisible invisible woods woods above above the the sheer sheer cliff cliff that that
formed formed the the central central shore shore of of the the cove cove between between the the is is hard hard to to
be be quite quite sure sure of of the the direction direction in in this this fog and and there there was was only only one one

some some minutes minutes the the two two sat sat still listening but but the the sound sound was was not not
repeated incredible incredible that that any any human human being being should should be be so so near near on on
the the big big island island where where neither neither white white men men nor nor were were ever ever known known to to
come come intentionally was was inclined inclined to to think think mistaken
younger younger boy boy had had certainly certainly heard heard some some sharp sharp sound but but could could scarcely scarcely
believe believe it it was was the the report report of of a a gun

the the mere mere suspicion suspicion that that any any other other man man might might be be near near by by was was
enough enough to to make make the the proceed proceed with with the the greatest greatest caution by by the the
had had been been caused caused by by the the warm warm shower shower falling falling on on the the lake lake during during
the the could could be be seen seen only only by by very very near near at at hand but but
there there were were other other ways ways in in which which they they might might be be sound sound of of their their
or or the the smell smell of of the the smoke smoke from from their their cooking cooking fire fire might might
reveal reveal their their presence secret secret nature nature of of their their quest quest made made them them anxious anxious
that that their their visit visit to to the the island island should should not not become become known they they lighted lighted
no no fire on on the the cold cold remains remains of of last last corn corn porridge porridge
sprinkled sprinkled with with maple maple sugar talked talked little little and and in in and and
care care to to make make the the least least possible possible noise

decided decided to to give give at at least least one one more more day day to to the the search search for for the the
the the the the steep steep slope slope and and made made their their way way to to the the head head of of the the
fissure there there the the fog fog was was much much less less thick thick than than down down in in the the cove
crack crack in in the the rock rock had had narrowed narrowed to to a a mere mere slit slit almost almost choked choked with with tree tree
roots roots upon upon which which fallen fallen leaves leaves and and litter litter had had the the edge in in a a
depression depression where where there there was was a a little little soil stood stood a a clump clump of of birch birch
growing growing up up about about the the stump stump of of an an old old broken broken tree their their search search for for
some some blaze blaze or or mark mark that that might might guide guide them the the two two thought thought they they had had
every every tree tree in in the the vicinity

morning as as he he was was about about to to pass pass the the clump clump of of
to to notice notice what what a a rapid rapid growth growth the the had had made made that that season sight sight
of of the the new new growth growth something something to to him to to pull pull apart apart and and
bend bend back back the the little little trees trees to to get get a a better better view view of of the the old old stump
concealed concealed by by the the young young growth was was the the mark mark he he sought piece piece of of the the
ragged gray bark bark had had been been sliced sliced away and and on on the the bare
crumbly crumbly wood wood had had been been cut cut a a transverse transverse groove groove with with an an arrow arrow point

promptly promptly cut cut in in the the old old stump stump to to prove prove
that that the the might might not after after all have have been been stolen stolen from from the the hole hole in in the the
rocks arrow arrow pointed pointed directly directly along along the the overgrown overgrown crack which which the the
for for fifty fifty or or sixty sixty feet feet farther when when it it came came abruptly abruptly to to an an
end had had come come to to a a hollow hollow or or gully crack crack distinctly distinctly in in
the the steep steep rock rock wall but but the the bottom bottom of of the the hollow hollow and and the the opposite opposite
gradual gradual slope slope were were deep deep with with soil soil and and thick thick with with growth rift which which
at at the the outer outer end end into into a a cleft it it was was apparent clear clear
through through the the rock rock ridge ridge that that formed formed the the shore shore cliff had had now now
the the lower lower ground ground behind behind that that ridge way way should should they they turn turn
next

question question was was promptly abrupt abrupt face face of of the the rock rock wall wall was was
well well overgrown overgrown with with green green moss moss and and one one place place the the
short thick thick growth growth had had been been away away to to expose expose a a strip strip of of the the gray gray
stone stone about about an an inch inch wide wide and and six six or or seven seven inches inches long clean-cut cleancut
appearance appearance of of the the scratch scratch to to prove prove that that it it had had been been made made with with a a
knife knife or or some some other other sharp sharp instrument slowly slowly do do moss moss and and
spread spread on on a a rock rock surface surface that that such such a a mark mark would would remain remain clear clear and and distinct distinct
for for one one season season at at least probably probably for for several several years was was no no arrow arrow
point point here but but the the scratch scratch was was to to the the left left of of the the crack turned turned
unhesitatingly unhesitatingly in in that that direction

growth growth in in this this low low place place was was dense had had to to push push their their way way among among
old ragged ragged and and close close standing standing draped draped with with gray gray of of
lichen lichen which which were were the the lifeblood on on the the steep steep
rock rock wall on on each each tree tree trunk they they sought sought for for another another sign several several
hundred hundred they they found found nothing until until they they came came to to a a cross cross gully gully
running running back back towards towards the the lake the the very very entrance entrance stood stood a a small broken broken
birch slender slender stem stem was was not not completely completely severed the the top top of of the the tree tree
resting resting on on the the ground

is is our our said said as as soon soon as as he he caught caught sight sight of of the the birch

is is only only a a broken broken protested see see nothing nothing to to show show that that
it it is is a a

see see promptly there there is is the the
position right right here here where where we we need need guidance tree tree has has been been broken broken so so
that that it it points points down down that that ravine break break is is not not old not not weathered weathered
enough enough to to have have before before last last winter it it before before the the
leaves leaves came came out were were still still in in the the bud was was in in late late winter winter or or
early early spring spring that that tree tree was was

about about the the time time father father must must have have been been on on the the


on on with with his his explanation broke broke the the tree wind
are are not not easily easily broken broken by by wind sway they they bend
sometimes sometimes they they are are tipped tipped over over at at the the roots the the stem stem itself itself is is not not
broken broken unless unless it it is is rotten rotten or or the the storm storm violent are are no no signs signs of of
strong strong wind are are no no other other broken broken trees trees near near this this

is is looking looking about about him

we we will will look look at at the the continued continued confidently the the
trunk trunk is is sound but but it it has has been been cut cut with with an an cut cut deep deep and and bent bent down
here look look usually usually calm calm voice voice was was thrilling thrilling with with
excitement was was pointing pointing to to some some small small in in the the white white bark bark just just
below below the the break



laid laid his his finger finger on on his his lips lips to to remind remind his his companion companion that that caution caution
must must still still be be observed had had heard heard no no further further sound sound and and had had seen seen no no
sign sign of of a a human human being but but the the half-breed halfbreed lad lad had had not not forgotten forgotten the the sharp sharp
report report that that had had so so startled startled him him in in the the dawn was was best best to to move move silently silently
and and speak speak with with lowered lowered voice

led led the the way way down down the the narrow narrow cross cross gully so so narrow narrow that that where where a a
tree tree trees trees to to grow grow everywhere everywhere on on this this wild wild island island where where
they they could could push push down down a a was was scarcely scarcely room room to to get get by a a

is is no no place place here here to to hide hide

who who was was still still ahead did did not not answer was was closely closely scanning scanning the the
rock rock wall wall on on either either side moment moment later he he and and a a little little
grunt grunt of of interest interest or or satisfaction

is is asked

another another step step forward and and pointed pointed to to the the right right hand hand wall
narrow narrow fissure fissure extended extended from from top top to to bottom narrow narrow was was the the crack crack that that
rather rather whether whether he he could could squeeze squeeze into into it

will will go go first am am cannot cannot go go
through we we shall shall know know that that no no man man has has been been in in

and and lithe found found that that he he could could wriggle wriggle his his way way through through
without without much much difficulty found found the the
task task less less easy had had to to go go and and for for a a moment moment he he thought thought he he
should should stick stick fast but but he he managed managed to to squeeze squeeze past past the the spot to to
find find himself himself in in an an almost almost round round hollow hole hole or or pit pit in in the the outer outer
ridge ridge was was perhaps perhaps twenty twenty feet feet in in diameter diameter with with abrupt abrupt rock rock walls walls and and a a
floor floor of of and and pebbles among among which which a a few few hardy hardy
was was open open to to the the sky sky and and ringed ringed at at the the top top with with shrubby shrubby growth
about about him him with with a a keen keen sense sense of of disappointment the the
were were not not in in this this place

on on the the other other side side of of a a scraggly scraggly bush to to be be
a a pile pile of of and and rock rock older older boy boy rounded rounded
the the bush and and disappointment disappointment way way to to excitement what what agency agency had had
those those stones stones been been heaped heaped in in that that particular particular spot had had not not fallen fallen
from from the the wall wall beyond pit pit had had no no opening opening through through which which waves waves could could
wash that that heap heap been been put put together together by by the the hand hand of of man it it indeed indeed a a
cache

a a word word spoken the the two two set set about about the the stone stone pile
after after another another they they each each stone stone and and it it aside he he rolled rolled
away away one one of of the the larger larger could could not not restrain restrain a a little little cry
bit bit of of withered withered cedar cedar had had come come to to light eager eager energy energy he he away away
the the remaining remaining stones lay lay revealed revealed a a heap heap of of something something covered covered with with
cedar cedar the the flat flat withered withered but but still still aromatic woven woven
together together closely closely to to form form a a tight tight and and waterproof waterproof covering and and around around
them the the stones stones had had been been heaped heaped to to conceal conceal every every sprig

flying flying fingers the the pulled pulled the the apart were were the the

by by their their sale would would well well repay repay in in gold gold for for all all the the long long
search to to do do the the justice neither neither was was thinking thinking just just then then of of
the the worth worth of of the the feeling feeling was was rather rather of of satisfaction satisfaction that that
they they were were really really carrying carrying out out their their last last command long long and and
difficult difficult search search was was over and and they they had had not not failed failed in in it

the the from from a a platform platform of of poles poles resting resting on on stones
whole whole cache cache had had been been cleverly cleverly animal animal could could tear tear apart apart the the

think think it it is is this this

package package he he was was to to be be just just like like the the others except except
that that into into the the rawhide rawhide thong thong that that bound bound it it had had been been twisted twisted a a bit bit of of
scarlet scarlet wool wool from from a a cap cap or or sash would would have have untied untied the the
thong but but the the impatient impatient cut cut it and and stripped stripped off off the the wrapping
bale bale contained contained otter otter of of fine fine quality two two of of the the was was

with with a a blotch blotch of of pitch pitch into into which which had had been been pressed pressed the the seal seal of of the the ring ring
now now

we we open open this this here here and and now asked

is is for for you you to to say my my brother are are the the

think think we we had had best best open open it it at at

broke broke the the seal seal and and was was about about to to untie untie the the cord when when from from somewhere somewhere
above above the the rim rim of of the the pit there there out out a a loud longdrawn call
was was not not the the cry cry of of an an animal was was a a human human
voice








thrust thrust the the unopened unopened packet packet into into the the breast breast of of his his deerskin deerskin
tunic and and up up at at the the border border of of green green about about the the rim rim
of of the the pit man man who who had had shouted shouted could could not not be be far far away might might be be
others others even even nearer should should push push through through that that protecting protecting fringe fringe

would would be be in in plain plain view

thought thought quickly must must conceal conceal the the again he he
whispered we we can can find find some some way way to to get get them them to to the the

will will take take them them away away at at

and and with with many many an an apprehensive apprehensive glance glance upward the the two two the the

the the kettle kettle had had been been over over the the fire from from his his breast breast the the
packet packet and and the the outside outside carefully wrapping wrapping was was of of oiled oiled

we we open open it he he asked asked again

younger younger boy boy cast cast a a quick quick glance glance about about him at at the the rock rock slope slope they they had had

drops drops of of pitch pitch upon upon which which seal seal had had been been pressed
several several minutes minutes the the boy boy sat sat considering considering what what he he ought ought to to do he he
up up at at his his equally equally grave grave face

like like to to open open said is is addressed addressed to to
of of and and it it is is sealed think think father father intended intended me me to to take take
it it to to with with the the seals seals unbroken he he will will open open it it
in in my my presence presence and and tell tell me me what what it it

understandingly had had lived lived long long enough enough in in civilization civilization
to to realize realize the the seriousness seriousness of of breaking breaking the the seals seals of of a a packet packet addressed addressed to to

know know my my father father had had any any friends friends in in never never lived lived
there you you know old old home home was was in in where where was was born
remember remember that that ever ever heard heard of of but but my my in in
may may know know him can can find find him then then think think
it it would would be be right right to to open open this this packet but but not not until until have have tried
take take charge charge of of this

are are the the elder elder and and our our father father said said you you must must take take the the packet packet to to


the the impatient impatient the the wait wait until until the the sun sun beyond beyond the the woods woods
of of the the low low point point across across the the water water long long indeed found found it it hard hard to to
realize realize that that only only two two nights nights before before he he and and had had the the point point
and and had had tied tied up up there had had surely surely been been lucky lucky to to find find the the cache cache of of
so so soon

until until the the shadows shadows of of the the shore shore lay lay deep deep upon upon the the water water did did the the
push push off off the the bateau silently silently out out of of the the little little cove cove and and
close close under under the the abrupt rocks taking taking care care not not to to let let a a blade blade
splash splash as as it it dipped dipped and and was was water water was was rippled rippled by by the the
of of and and the the moon moon was was bright deep deep cleft cleft where where
wrecked wrecked boat boat lay lay was was in in black black darkness though could could not not
even even make make out out the the stern mind mind was was busy busy with with thoughts thoughts of of the the father father he he
had had known known so so slightly with with about about his his coming coming to to the the island
about about the the way way he he had had left left it what what treachery treachery had had he he received received his his
death death blow

rift rift in in the the rock rock was was passed passed before before the the a a
cleft cleft they they felt felt sure sure was was the the one one leading leading to to the the cache
they they turned turned into into the the dark dark mouth mouth of of the the fissure fissure and and grounded grounded
the the boat boat on on the the pebbles waterworn and and rounded rounded here here where where the the waves waves
them the the moonlight moonlight down down among among the the thick thick
of of the the stunted stunted that that along along the the rim rim and and even even down down into into the the
crack the the darkness darkness at at the the bottom bottom was was so so deep deep the the could could
proceed proceed only only by by feeling feeling their their way way with with both both hands hands and and feet this this
manner manner they they up up over over pebbles pebbles and and angular angular rock rock to to the the narrow narrow
slit slit in in the the wall and and through through in in pitch pitch blackness blackness to to the the circular circular
hollow

was was moonlight moonlight in in the the pit but but the the cache close close under under the the rock rock wall
was was in in the the shadow difficult difficult did did the the find find it it to to remove remove the the stones stones
in in the the darkness that that they they decided decided to to risk risk lighting lighting a a torch the the
afternoon afternoon had had made made a a couple couple of of of of spruce spruce and and balsam
lighted lighted one one now now and and stuck stuck it it in in a a cranny cranny of of the the rock rock just just above above the the heap heap
of of stones the the feeble flickering flickering and and smoky smoky light the the cache cache was was
uncovered and and hauling hauling the the through through the the narrow narrow crack crack was was
difficult difficult and and troublesome larger larger ones ones would would not not go go through and and had had
to to be be unwrapped unwrapped and and reduced reduced to to smaller smaller parcels by by the the dim dim light light of of
the the torch the the could could see see that that the the were were of of excellent excellent quality
loading the the bateau bateau had had to to be be pushed pushed out out a a little little way
standing standing in in the the water water to to hold hold it it while while in in the the both both
in in and and quietly quietly out out of of the the crack

was was not not breeze breeze enough enough for for sailing and and were were anxious anxious to to
get get away away from from the the spot spot where where they they had had found found the the and and had had heard heard the the
shout but but the the heavily heavily laden laden bateau bateau was was slow slow work a a
breeze breeze to to fill fill the the sail they they were were loth loth to to start start across across the the open open lake so so
they they kept kept on on along along shore shore to to the the northeast they they had had put put a a mile mile or or
more more between between themselves themselves and and the the place place where where they they had had found found the the they they
would would camp camp and and wait wait for for sunrise sunrise and and a a breeze

and and laboriously laboriously they they on close close to to the the high high shore
calm moonlit moonlit water water stretched stretched away away on on their their left dark
rocks huge worn worn and and seamed seamed pillars forbiddingly forbiddingly
on on the the other other side last last the the view view of of the the water water ahead ahead and and the the
barrenness barrenness of of the the rocks rocks to to the the right right indicated indicated that that they they were were
reaching reaching the the end end of of the the shore shore along along which which they they had had been been

land land said said soon soon as as we we can can find find a a

abrupt truncated truncated pillars pillars of of rock rock were were not not so so high high here but but were were
bordered bordered at at the the edge edge with with broken broken blocks blocks and and great great
little little chance chance of of a a landing landing place close close in
however slowly slowly and and cautiously cautiously to to avoid avoid disaster the the discovered discovered a a
niche niche between between two two blocks blocks of of rock with with water water deep deep enough enough to to permit permit
running running the the boat boat in they they out out on on the the rock rock and and the the
bateau bateau by by a a couple couple of of turns turns of of the the rope rope around around a a smaller smaller block rough rough
weather weather such such a a landing landing would would have have been been impossible but but on on this this still still
night night there there was was no no danger danger of of the the bateau bateau upon upon the the rocks
along along found found a a spot spot where where the the solid solid rock rock shelved shelved down down gradually
themselves themselves in in their their the the stretched stretched out out on on the the
hard hard bed

plaintive plaintive crying crying of of just just as as the the sun sun was was coming coming up up
from from the the water a a great great red red ball ball in in the the morning morning mist like like this this
he he said said as as he he sat sat up can can be be seen seen plainly plainly from from the the

agreed we we can can see see far far across across the the lake a a boat boat
comes we we shall shall see see it it while while it it is is yet yet a a long long way way off think think we we need need
not not fear fear anything anything from from that that direction the the only only way way an an enemy enemy can can draw draw
near near unseen unseen is is from from the the land from from the the woods woods farther farther back back

water water is is absolutely absolutely on a a capful capful of of
wind wind to to fill fill our our sail and and we we paddle paddle this this loaded loaded boat boat clear clear across across
to to the the mainland must must find find a a better better place place than than this though to to wait wait
for for a a breeze am am going going to to look look around around a a

soon soon found found that that they they were were near near the the end end of of a a point a a worn
rock rock point bare bare except except for for a a few few scraggly scraggly bushes of of
dwarfed dwarfed white white cedar cedar and and such such and and as as could could cling cling to to the the
surface back back were were woods evergreen two two felt felt that that
they they must must find find a a spot spot where where they they could could wait wait for for a a wind wind without without being being
visible visible from from the the woods they they wanted wanted to to remain remain where where they they could could watch watch
the the weather weather and and get get away away at at the the first first opportunity the the very very tip tip of of the the
point the the slate-gray rocks rocks were were abrupt slightly slightly overhanging overhanging indeed but but
in in one one spot spot there there lay lay exposed exposed at at the the base base a a few few feet feet of of low shelving
shore which which must must be be under under water water in in rough rough weather this this
calm calm day day the the lower lower rock rock shore shore was was dry in in the the shelter shelter of of the the
overhanging overhanging masses the the would would be be entirely entirely concealed concealed from from the the land land
side little little farther farther along along on on the the end end of of the the point rose rose an an abrupt
rounded rounded tower tower of of rock the the rock rock tower tower and and the the place place they they had had
selected selected for for themselves themselves was was a a narrow narrow inlet inlet where where the the bateau bateau would would be be
fairly fairly well well hidden the the boat boat out out from from between between the the
where where it it had had lain lain safe safe while while they they and and around around to to the the little little
inlet the the low low rock rock shore they they a a tiny tiny fire fire of of
dry dry sticks sticks gathered gathered at at the the edge edge of of the the woods and and hung hung the the kettle kettle from from a a
pole pole over over the the flames flames from from a a cranny cranny in in the the steep steep rock rock at at the the rear

wind wind did did not not come come up up as as the the sun sun rose rose higher as as the the had had it it
would delay delay was was trying especially especially to to the the impetuous impetuous had had
found found the the cache the the and and the the packet and and had had safely safely away away
with with them only only to to be be stuck stuck here here on on the the end end of of this this point point for for hours hours of of
idle idle waiting even even did did not not want want to to start start across across the the lake lake under under
the the present present conditions the the bateau bateau had had been been laborious laborious enough enough
when when it it was was empty but but now laden laden almost almost to to the the waterline the the boat boat was was
far far worse worse to to handle it it was was not not merely merely hard hard work but but progress progress
would would be be so so slow slow that that the the journey journey across across to to the the mainland mainland would would be be a a long long
one with with always always the the chance chance that that the the wind when when it it did did come might might blow blow
from from the the wrong wrong quarter bateau bateau would would not not sail sail against against the the wind
attempt attempt to to paddle paddle it it against against wind wind and and waves waves would would invite invite disaster
the the clumsy clumsy craft heavy heavy laden laden as as it it was across across the the open open water water
with with a a fair fair wind wind would would be be quite quite perilous perilous enough was was nothing nothing to to do do
but but wait and and this this as as good good a a place place in in which which to to wait wait as as any any they they
were were likely likely to to find








the the morning morning advanced the the sun sun hot beating beating down down on on the the water water and and
heat heat from from the the rocks a a ripple ripple wrinkled wrinkled the the blue blue
surface surface of of the the lake and and the the distance distance was was hazy hazy and and island island
with with steep straight straight sides four four or or five five northeast northeast of of the the point

briefly

is is coming coming agreed this this is is not not a a good good place place to to be be
caught caught in in a a thick thick fog we we go go back back into into the the

think think we we had had best best take take the the bateau bateau and and go go along along the the other other side side of of this this
point cannot cannot start start for for the the mainland mainland tonight and and we we shall shall need need a a
sheltered sheltered place place for for our our

fog fog did did not not seem seem to to be be coming coming in in very very but but by by the the time time the the
bateau bateau had had been been off the the island island across across the the water water had had

on on the the open open lake was was thickening and and the the kept kept a a lookout lookout for for a a
camping camping place

an an opening opening on on the the left left revealed revealed what what to to be be a a sheltered sheltered bay
they they turned turned in two two points points lay lay two two tiny tiny one one so so small small it it

direction on on between between the the thickly thickly forested forested dense dense mass mass of of
spruce balsam white white cedar birch birch and and mountain mountain saw saw that that what what
they they had had taken taken for for the the end end of of the the bay bay was was in in reality reality an an almost almost round round
islet islet so so thickly thickly wooded wooded that that the the of of its its big big white white

narrow narrow opening slowly slowly and and taking taking care care to to avoid avoid the the rocks rocks that that

bateau bateau to to pass pass through they they entered entered a a little little landlocked landlocked bay as as secluded secluded
and and peaceful peaceful as as an an inland inland pond

mainland

to to the the northeast they they the the way way they they had had come come the the preceding preceding
afternoon they they the the end end of of the the last last island they they
that that this this was was no no time time to to attempt attempt a a crossing there there was was now too too much much
wind came came from from the the northwest and and the the lake a a deep deep green green under under the the
gray gray sky was was heaving heaving with with big big waves their their tips tips touched touched with with foam
bateau bateau would would not not sail sail against against that that wind try try to to paddle paddle the the
boat boat across across those those waves waves would would be be the the worst worst sort sort of of folly

again they they slowly slowly back back through through the the protected protected channel
the the blade blade while while was was still still against against them
there there were were no no fish fish in in the the channel channel or or they they were were not not hungry
beyond beyond the the entrance entrance to to the the hiding hiding place the the two two the the

and and dipped dipped his his paddle paddle again they they near near a a reef reef
running running out out from from the the end end of of a a small small island felt felt his his line line tighten

minutes had had a a trout trout somewhat somewhat smaller smaller than than

luck luck deserted deserted them them again another another fish fish to to the the lure lure of of
the the hook though though they they back back and and forth forth beside beside the the reef reef several several
times on on along along the the little little island island and and up up the the bay bay for for another another
mile mile or or more more without without a a nibble was was a a wonderful wonderful place that that lonely lonely bay
fascinating fascinating in in its its wild wild beauty steep densely densely wooded wooded the the
deep deep green green of of the the and and with with
in in close close ranks the the the the
clear transparent transparent water water was was edged edged with with
mountain mountain ashes and and other other bushes and and dotted dotted with with wooded wooded
beyond beyond the the head head of of the the bay bay blue blue hills hills rose rose against against the the sky
fishing however was was disappointing and and the the bateau bateau was was tiresome tiresome
work so so the the turned turned back

to to the the boat startled startled a a gull gull perched perched upon upon the the prow and and the the bird bird rose rose
with with a a harsh harsh cry cry of of protest protest at at being being disturbed the the cry cry was was
repeated repeated twice a a little little more more faintly faintly each each time about about for for
the the birds birds that that had had other other were were in in sight he he
that that what what he he had had heard heard was was a a double double echo unusually unusually loud loud and and
clear caution caution he he let let out out a a loud came came back back
promptly

words words were were in in a a low low voice as as out out
from from among among the the trees are are coming must must

back back into into the the woods following they they made made their their

to to his his side and through through a a bush
out out across across the the water

warning warning had had been been justified several several men men in in each were were
coming coming up up the the bay nearest nearest canoe canoe was was not not too too far far away away for for to to
make make out out in in the the center center a a man man who who tall tall and and broad above above the the
others boy boy remembered remembered the the gigantic gigantic against against the the sky
as as his his canoe canoe passed passed in in the the early early dawn saw saw him him again standing standing
motionless with with folded folded arms in in the the red red light light of of the the fire

close close beside beside him whispered whispered in in his his ear himself
shall shall we we

the the came came down down the the side side of of the the island island where where the the bateau bateau was
discovery discovery was was inevitable a a moment mind mind refused refused to to work
gull gull out out over over the the water screaming screaming shrilly a a ray ray of of light light a a
plan plan into into the the head

he he whispered still the the of of

back back and and down down through through the the woods woods to to the the spot spot
where where the the bateau bateau lay crouched crouched behind behind an an alder alder bush a a long long
breath and and sent sent a a loud shrill shrill cry cry across across the the water it it was was
repeated repeated once twice ringing ringing back back across across the the channel channel from from the the
and and steep steep shore shore beyond the the final final echo echo had had away he he sent sent his his
voice voice forth forth again this this time time in in a a hoarse hoarse bellow in in rapid rapid
succession he he like like an an owl like like a a dog like like a a wolf
piercingly piercingly with with two two fingers fingers in in his his mouth imitated imitated the the mocking mocking
laughter laughter of of the the loon and and and and and and in in every every
manner manner he he could could devise devise and and with with all all the the power power of of his his strong strong young young lungs
and and cracked cracked of of his his voice not not yet yet through through turning turning
from from to to made made his his and and and and the the more more weird weird
and and demoniac each each sound sound was was repeated repeated once once and and again producing producing a a
veritable veritable pandemonium pandemonium of of unearthly unearthly noises noises which which to to come come from from every every
side

to to take take breath was was himself himself startled startled by by another another voice not not
an an echo echo of of his his own which which out out from from somewhere somewhere above above him loud loud and and
shrill spoke spoke words words he he did did not not understand and and no no echo echo came came back
second second time time the the voice voice out still still in in the the same same strange strange language but but
now now recognized recognized the the names names and and and and then to to his his
amazement that that of of his his own own father father an an instant instant the the lad lad
almost almost believed believed that that this this was was indeed indeed a a of of but but a a spirit spirit
could could be be calling calling the the name name of of in in this this remote remote place but but
other other son was was of of course crying crying out out in in
from from up up there there at at the the top top of of the the island had had uttered uttered some some threat threat
against against

his his own own part part in in the the game sent sent out out another another
hollow threatening threatening owl owl call toot
ghostly ghostly repeated repeated it once twice he he and and and and
tried tried to to scream scream like like a a lynx was was in in the the midst midst of of the the maniacal maniacal loon loon
laugh when when through through the the trees trees to to his his side

run run away my my quick flashing flashing smile smile that that marked marked him him as as
son son crossed crossed the the face have have turned turned their their
and and paddle paddle full full speed you you called called up up have have frightened frightened them them
away a a moment before before understood understood what what you you were were about those those spirit spirit
frightened frightened me me

you you frightened frightened you you shouted shouted from from
up up

grim grim expression expression the the smile farther farther canoe canoe had had
turned but but the the first first still still came came on with with urging urging his his
too too played played spirit let let us us go go back back and and see see if if they they still still run run

sent sent out out another another roar roar or or two two and and added added a a war war
whoop whoop and and a a very very good good imitation imitation of of the the angry angry cat cat scream scream of of a a lynx
both both hurriedly hurriedly through through the the trees trees to to the the top top of of the the island island and and
sought sought the the spot spot where where they they had had first first watched watched the the approaching approaching
were were still still visible but but farther farther away away and and moving moving down down the the
bay

think think this this a a bay bay of of echoes echoes served served us us
well what what was was it it you you said said to to them

said no no farther farther or or you you die every every heard heard and and
held held their their motionless said of of the the of of
murderer murderer of of our our white white son

believe believe it it was who who killed killed

know know not thought thought came came into into my my head head that that if if he he was was the the man man he he
might might be be frightened frightened if if he he heard heard that that the the of of the the deed he he
was was

he he order order the the canoe canoe

heard heard no no order sat sat quite quite still made made no no move move to to stay stay his his men men
when when they they turned turned the the canoe canoe about is is a a bold bold man yet yet he he was was
frightened

it it one one of of those those we we saw saw yesterday do do you you

may may be but but was was not not in in it is is so so big far far away away though though they they
were we we should should have have seen seen

have have helped helped seeing seeing him wonder wonder if if they they came came around around the the end end
of of the the long long point could could they they in in such such a a

may may be be that that the the waves waves have have gone gone down down out out there how how still still the the
water water is is in in here here

we we can can start start for for the the mainland must must go go back are are out out
of of

no that that would would be be folly they they go go straight straight out out of of this this bay bay all all
will will be be well but but we we know know not not where where they they go go or or how how far far or or where where they they may may
lie lie in in wait no we we have have frightened frightened them them away away from from this this spot
but but we we dare dare not not leave leave it it ourselves ourselves until until darkness darkness

but but the the latter latter was was not not inexperienced inexperienced in in rough rough going he he had had
extraordinary extraordinary difficulties had had been been obliged obliged to to go go far far
around or or had had become become lost he he should should have have been been back back long long before
possibility possibility that that had had become become lost from from his his mind mind at at

to to cross cross to to the the shore shore bordering bordering on on the the channel channel that that separated separated the the island island
from from the the long long point the the woods woods he he as as direct direct a a route route as as he he
could growth growth was was thick but but there there was was still still plenty plenty of of light a a
very very few few minutes minutes he he saw saw the the gleam gleam of of water water among among the the trees trees ahead

between between the the bushes along along his his own own side side of of the the
channel then then made made his his way way quickly quickly to to the the spot spot where where a a birch birch tree tree had had
from from its its insecure insecure hold hold into into the the water his his sharp sharp hatchet
the the boy boy quickly quickly severed severed the the roots roots that that were were mooring mooring the the fallen fallen tree tree to to
the the shore with with some some difficulty he he in in the the birch birch

with with that that swept swept the the water bow bow touched touched the the shore and and
out out and and made made the the boat boat fast felt felt sure sure it it would would be be concealed concealed
from from down down channel channel by by the the thick thick foliage foliage of of the the cedar up up channel channel the the
bateau bateau was was not not so so well well hidden but but this this place place to to be be the the only only spot spot
that that offered offered any any concealment concealment whatever so so he he was was forced forced to to be be content
would would not not be be gone gone long long and and he he was was well well satisfied satisfied that that and and
his his band band would would not not return return soon soon to to the the of of

was was by by no no means means the the first first time time had had been been through through untracked untracked woods woods
and and over over rough rough ground yet yet he he found found the the trip trip to to the the ridge ridge top top longer longer and and
more more difficult difficult than than he he had had expected growth principally principally of of
was was dense dense and and often often troublesome troublesome to to push push through bedrock
a a few few feet feet from from shore was was covered covered deeply deeply with with soft soft leaf leaf mould mould and and
decayed decayed wood wood and and litter forming forming a a treacherous treacherous footing he he
found found it it firm firm beneath beneath his his feet again again he he would would sink sink halfway to to his his
knees a a tree tree had had fallen the the dense dense shade of of
ground ground yew yew had had sprung sprung up rise rise on on this this side side of of the the point point was was gradual gradual
compared compared with with the the abrupt abrupt of of the the northwest northwest side but but the the slope slope
proved proved to to be not not an an unbroken unbroken grade but but an an irregular irregular succession succession of of low low
with with shallow shallow between the the general general upward upward trend
occasional occasional of of the the water water behind behind him and and the the angle angle at at which which the the
sunlight sunlight came came through through the the trees kept kept his his main main direction going going in in
as as straight straight a a line line as as he he could ordinary ordinary circumstances circumstances he he would would
have have used used his his hatchet hatchet to to blaze blaze his his way so so that that he he might might be be sure sure of of
returning returning by by the the same same route but but he he to to leave leave so so plain plain a a trail
was was not not likely likely that that would would come come across across the the track but but was was
taking taking no no chances the the giant giant should should come come down down the the channel channel and and
find find the the bateau a a blazed blazed trail trail into into the the woods woods would would make make pursuit pursuit
altogether altogether too too easy he he was was in in too too great great a a hurry hurry to to take take any any
particular particular care care to to avoid avoid leaving leaving did did not not mark mark his his trail trail
intentionally intentionally and and even even from from cutting cutting his his way way through through the the thick thick
places whole whole distance distance from from the the shore shore to to the the summit summit of of the the highest highest
ridge ridge probably probably did did not not exceed exceed a a mile and and did did not not actually actually take take as as long long
as as it it in in the the climbing

that that he he might might come come out out in in a a bare bare spot spot where where he he could could see see across across
the the water but but he he was was disappointed ridge ridge was was almost almost flat flat topped topped and and
trees trees cut cut off off his his view view in in every every direction on on across across the the summit
however he he pushed pushed his his way way among among the the growth to to find find himself himself standing standing on on
the the very very rim rim of of an an almost almost vertical vertical descent directly directly down down upon upon
the the tops tops of of the the sturdy sturdy trees trees and and that that to to the the rock rock by by
their their roots roots far far into into holes holes and and stretched stretched the the
lake rich rich blue blue under under a a clear clear sky little little to to his his left a a projecting projecting
block block of of rock rock a a few few feet feet below below offered offered a a chance chance for for a a better better view let let
himself himself down down on on the the rock rock and and an an observation lake lake was was not not too too
rough rough to to venture venture out out upon when when the the need need of of crossing crossing was was so so great
noted noted with with satisfaction satisfaction that that the the breeze breeze was was only only moderate direction

though though steering steering a a straight straight course course for for the the would would be be
impossible

turned turned to to climb climb back back the the way way he he had had come come down a a gasp
almost almost lost lost his his footing and and seized seized a a sturdy sturdy juniper juniper root root to to keep keep himself himself
from from falling above above him on on the the verge verge of of the the ridge stood stood a a
strange strange man from from his his features dark dark skin skin and and long long black black hair hair

had had no no difficulty difficulty finding finding the the place place where where had had gone gone into into the the
woods white white boy boy thought thought he he had had been been careful careful about about leaving leaving a a trail
but but to to the the half-breed halfbreed lad lad the the were were plain plain enough of of the the
tracks tracks were were such such as as might might have have been been made made by by any any large large animal but but
had had landed landed at at this this spot spot intending intending to to go go directly directly to to the the ridge ridge
top younger younger boy boy was was confident confident that that trampled trampled in in
the the leaf leaf mould broken broken were were all all signs signs of of his his
passage

first first he he the the trail trail easily but but the the long long northern northern twilight twilight was was
waning the the darkness darkness gathered gathered in in the the woods increasingly increasingly
difficult had had no no wish wish to to attract attract attention attention by by lighting lighting a a torch
he he penetrated penetrated the the thick thick growth he he was was not not only only unable unable to to find find
trail but but was was obliged obliged sometimes sometimes to to feel feel his his own own way way and and was was in in grave grave
doubt doubt whether whether he he was was going going aright out out into into a a more more open open spot
where where several several trees trees had had fallen he he as as well well as as he he could could in in the the
dim dim light the the for for some some sign sign that that had had
over over them fresh fresh break break where where the the decayed decayed wood wood had had crumbled crumbled away away under under
foot a a patch patch of of bruised bruised moss the the delicate delicate fruiting fruiting broken broken and and
crushed were were enough enough to to convince convince him him that that he he was was still still on on the the right right
track

losing losing the the trail trail and and finding finding it it again he he came came to to the the summit summit
of of the the ridge the the top he he found found himself himself on on the the rim rim of of the the cliff
but but not not in in the the same same spot spot where where his his brother brother had had come come out had had
trail trail on on the the last last upward upward slope and and was was now now a a hundred hundred feet feet or or more more
to to the the left left of of the the projecting projecting block block of of rock a a few few minutes minutes
stood stood looking looking about about him out out over over the the water that that the the
sky sky was was partly partly cloud cloud covered could could make make out out the the low low point and and he he
that that the the rock rock shore shore with with the the must must lie lie almost almost directly directly
below below him twin twin where where he he and and had had could could not not be be far far
to to the the left was was not not concerned concerned just just now now with with either either place he he was was
merely merely the the instinct instinct to to note note his his whereabouts whereabouts and and to to take take
his his bearings

lad lad was was at at a a loss loss how how to to proceed had had the the rim rim of of
the the ridge ridge somewhere somewhere along along here here more more than than probable had had he he
gone gone then could could scarcely scarcely believe believe that that his his elder elder brother brother had had
attempted attempted to to climb climb down down that that abrupt abrupt descent he he had had gone gone down down there there
and and through through the the woods woods and and over over the the rocks rocks to to the the water he he could could have have
no no better better view view of of the the open open had had been been in in haste he he had had
certainly certainly not not gone gone down down there there of of his his own own accord he he had had back back
the the way way he he had had come what what had had to to him shook shook his his head head in in
perplexity only only one one thing thing was was he he sure disaster disaster had had overtaken overtaken
he he made made a a and and plunged plunged down down the the cliff or or had had
something something to to do do with with his his disappearance

first first thing thing to to do decided was was to to search search along along the the ridge ridge top top
for for some some further further sign sign of of or or of of what what had had him turned turned to to
the the right right and and made made his his way way along along as as close close to to the the edge edge as as he he could
down down every every few few paces paces to to seek seek for for some some clue night night was was
lighter lighter now for for the the moon moon had had come come out out from from behind behind the the clouds he he
the the spot spot just just above above the the projecting projecting rocks stopped stopped still
was was no no need need to to search search for for signs signs here they they were were quite quite plain
moon moon down down on on the the little little open open space space where where and and the the strange strange
had had one one another was was clear clear to to the the half-breed halfbreed boy boy
that that there there had had been been a a struggle gray gray caribou caribou moss moss was was crushed crushed and and
trampled trampled and and torn torn up up by by the the roots branch branch of of a a little little on on the the
edge edge of of the the opening opening a a fresh fresh break break and and hanging hanging from from that that branch branch was was
a a torn torn scrap scrap of of deerskin that that was was not not all on on the the moss in in
plain plain sight sight in in the the moonlight was was a a small dark dark object a a bit bit of of steel steel
such such as as was was commonly commonly used used with with a a piece piece of of flint flint for for fire fire making
picked picked up up the the steel was was the the one one carried beyond beyond doubt

did did those those marks marks of of struggle struggle mean were were too too far far back back to to indicate indicate
that that had had lost lost his his footing footing and and over over the the edge seizing seizing the the
tree tree to to keep keep himself himself from from falling that that was was quite quite impossible for for the the
at at least least ten ten feet feet from from the the rim rim of of the the cliff
with with some some animal of of no no animal animal likely at at that that season season
of of the the year to to make make an an attack attack upon upon a a man felt felt sure sure that that
had had too too much much sense sense to to strike strike first first with with knife knife or or hatchet hatchet at at a a bear bear
or or moose if if an an animal animal had had slain slain him him it it would would scarcely scarcely have have
carried carried him him away indication indication pointed pointed to to an an encounter not not with with a a
beast but but with with a a man must must have have come come across across or or some some of of his his
followers they they killed killed him him or or taken taken him him prisoner they they had had killed killed
him him they they would would not not have have troubled troubled to to take take away away his his body would would have have
taken taken his his scalp scalp and and gone gone on on their their of of course course they they had had thrown thrown
him him over over the the cliff down down the the abrupt abrupt descent now now bathed bathed in in
moonlight he he seek seek down down there there for for or or in in some some other other direction
decided decided to to look look around around a a little little more more before before to to climb climb down

immediately immediately he he found found further further traces the the more more
crushed crushed moss moss and and broken broken bushes bushes and and trampled trampled plainly plainly
that that more more than than one one man man probably had had gone gone that that way way not not many many
hours hours before had had gone gone boldly boldly and and confidently careless careless of of leaving leaving a a
trail dropped dropped on on his his knees knees to to make make a a closer closer examination
moonlight moonlight helped helped him and and he he soon soon came came to to the the conclusion from from the the shape shape
of of a a footprint footprint impressed impressed clearly clearly in in a a bit bit of of loose loose earth that that one one man man at at
least least had had gone gone in in that that direction whether whether he he had had come come that that way way or or not
print print was was too too large large for for foot but a a little little farther farther on
found found another another smaller smaller track track that that he he thought thought might might be be pointed pointed
the the same same way way as as the the larger larger print

beginning beginning of of the the trail trail was was now now plain but but could could he he follow follow it it in in the the
darkness darkness of of the the woods must must try try would would go go as as far far as as he he
could taking taking care care not not to to lose lose the the tracks

did did not not succeed succeed in in following following far longer longer was was he he by by any any
knowledge knowledge of of the the general general direction direction those those he he was was pursuing pursuing would would be be likely likely
to to take the the trees trees the the moonlight moonlight was was of of little little assistance soon soon
lost lost the the tracks tracks and and was was compelled compelled to to go go back back to to the the starting starting point
tried tried again again and and lost lost the the trail trail a a second second time white white boy in in his his anxiety anxiety
and and impatience would would probably probably have have in in the the hopeless hopeless attempt
and and would would have have lost lost the the trail trail and and himself was was part part
though though he he was was over over fate he he when when to to wait wait as as well well as as
when when to to go go forward daylight daylight he he could could doubtless doubtless find find the the trail trail easily
and and could could cover cover in in a a few few minutes minutes ground ground that that in in darkness darkness might might take take him him
hours if if he he could could find find his his way way over over it it at at all seated seated himself himself on on a a
cushion cushion of of dry dry caribou caribou moss moss near near the the rim rim of of the the ridge ridge to to wait
sleeplessly sleeplessly and and

came came at at last the the light light was was strong strong enough enough to to make make it it possible possible
to to find find his his way way through through the the woods again again up up the the trail
tracks tracks he he had had to to follow follow and and had had lost lost in in the the first first bit bit of of dense dense
growth led led him not not through but but around around the the thick thick place into into a a sort sort of of
open open rock rock lane lane bordered bordered with with trees trees and and running running along along the the ridge ridge top
his his great great surprise when when he he the the end end of of the the open open stretch he he came came
upon upon a a clearly clearly defined defined trail was was not not merely merely a a track track made made by by one one or or
two two men men coming coming and and going going once evidence evidence of of having having been been
a a number number of of times soft soft of of the the do do not not wear wear a a path path as as
quickly quickly as as the the boots boots of of the the white white man but but this this trail trail was was well well enough enough
to to be be easily marked marked the the trees trees and and no no clearing clearing
had had been been done done other other than than the the breaking breaking or or off off of of an an occasional occasional
troublesome troublesome branch men men who who made made that that trail trail had had gone gone around around the the
instead instead of of cutting cutting through through or or them but but any any white white man man
who who anything anything of of running running could could have have it

half-breed halfbreed boy boy along along without without hesitation scarcely scarcely thinking thinking
of of the the trail trail itself but but with with eyes eyes and and ears ears open open for for signs signs of of other other human human
beings way way must must lead he he felt felt sure to to some some more more or or less less
permanent permanent camp fallen fallen into into hands hands or or into into those those of of
some some tribe tribe of of permanent permanent inhabitants inhabitants of of heartily heartily that that
it it might might be be the the latter if if they they were were inclined inclined to to be be hostile he he
such such an an unknown unknown people people less less than than he he did did the the too too well well known known


noiselessly with with every every sense sense alert the the boy boy caught caught sight sight of of
something something moving moving among among the the trees trees ahead he he dropped dropped to to the the
ground ground and and like like a a snake snake among among trees trees and and bushes bushes and and through through
to to the the left left of of the the trail a a dense dense clump clump of of
that that had had sprung sprung up up about about a a parent parent tree he he lay lay motionless he he
thought thought he he had had long long enough he he cautiously cautiously back back towards towards the the
trail bushes bushes a a little little distance distance away away in in the the direction direction from from which which
he he had had come a a glimpse glimpse of of a a black black head head told told the the boy boy he he had had just just an an
encounter

short short distance distance farther farther on the the trail trail turned turned to to the the right right and and plunged plunged
down down an an abrupt abrupt descent the the way way wound wound up up and and down down over over low low
the the outer outer of of which which were were steep steep to to abruptness and and through through boggy boggy
with with thick thick growth growth and and treacherous treacherous moss moss and and mud a a
general general downward downward trend the the trail trail led led at at last last to to almost almost level level ground
forward forward with with the the utmost utmost caution for for he he felt felt that that the the end end
must must be be near near at at hand this this lower lower ground near near the the water the the village village
or or camp camp must must be be situated the the lad lad stopped stood stood still still and and
the the air smoke








fall fall stunned stunned him him for for a a moment and and that that moment moment was was his his undoing
he he came came to to himself he he was was against against the the tree his his knife knife and and

asked

no no answer answer but but the the young young singsong singsong and and a a
sullen sullen grunt grunt from from the the older older savage the the boy boy made made another another attempt

to to tighten tighten his his grip grip and and the the one one to to prod prod the the captive captive in in the the back back

enough that that prod instead instead of of the the lad made made him him
blaze blaze with with anger blood blood to to his his face difficulty difficulty he he
restrained restrained himself himself from from turning turning to to give give battle one one cool cool spot spot in in his his

piece piece of of deerskin deerskin he he was was into into was was familiar familiar
enough enough with with ways ways to to grasp grasp the the significance significance of of the the fact fact that that the the
man man was was making making his his own own was was work if if there there were were
about was was evident evident that that in in this this camp camp there there were were no no or or
the the would would not not be be doing doing work

felt felt very very tired tired and and all all things things around around him him to to make make him him drowsy
a a few few minutes minutes the the captive captive had had fallen fallen fast fast asleep








sound sound of of opened opened his his eyes eyes to to find looking looking down down
on on him the the young young and and a a repulsive repulsive fellow fellow with with a a strip strip of of dirty dirty red red
cloth cloth bound bound about about his his black black hair latter latter had had just just come come from from
visiting visiting his his for for he he was was carrying carrying two two he he saw saw that that
was was awake he he turned turned away the the young young fellow after after the the boy boy

was was in in sight sight and and hearing hearing every every moment was was hungry but but he he was was
offered offered no no food thirsty but but he he to to ask ask for for a a drink
to to lie lie quiet quiet and and to to keep keep his his feelings feelings of of discomfort anxiety anxiety and and
apprehension apprehension from from his his face ground ground was was hard the the sun sun beat beat down down upon upon
his his head head and and face and and he he could could not not move move to to a a more more comfortable comfortable spot
with with difficulty difficulty could could he he roll roll over over on on his his side mental mental suffering
however was was far far worse worse than than his his physical physical discomfort discomfort and and pain

was was he he treated treated in in this this way whose whose hands hands had had he he fallen were were
they they going going to to do do to to him him and and for for what what or or whom whom were were they they waiting one one
possible possible explanation explanation of of his his treatment treatment was was that that he he had had fallen fallen into into the the
hands hands of of little little band band of of should should even even they they want want to to
take take him him prisoner looking looking for for the the hidden hidden cache cold cold chill chill
up up spine as as he he remembered remembered the the packet packet in in the the breast breast of of his his
shirt he he had had only only had had sense sense enough enough to to leave leave that that packet packet with with
must must surely surely come come to to light light should should his his strip strip him him to to torment torment or or
torture torture him the the fiendish fiendish scene scene in in the the firelight
that that what what it it meant meant to to fall fall into into the the hands hands of of the the giant giant
boy boy not not think think of of that tried tried to to assure assure himself himself that that the the outlaw outlaw
had had nothing nothing against against him any any rate rate he he must must not not give give way way to to fear he he
could could keep keep cool cool and and alert he he might might yet yet find find some some way way out out of of the the
that that threatened threatened him must find find a a way

such such thoughts thoughts running running through through his his head the the time time painfully
in in the the afternoon the the younger younger renewed renewed the the fire fire and and hung hung over over
it it an an iron iron pot pot of of water the the pot pot he he put put several several of of wild wild
rice rice and and rabbit rabbit meat meat cut cut into into small small pieces odor odor was was tempting tempting to to
nostrils but but he he to to keep keep his his hunger hunger from from showing showing in in his his
face

came stew stew was was ready but but the the pot pot was was not not three three
sat sat about about the the fire the the younger younger one one away away the the time time by by
playing playing on on a a crude crude native native flute flute with with three three holes sounds sounds produced produced
were were mournful mournful and and monotonous monotonous and and did did not not inspire inspire cheerfulness other other
two two sat sat idle the the seething seething mixture mixture in in the the kettle but but none none
made made a a move move to to dip dip into into it were were certainly certainly waiting waiting for for the the return return of of
the the rest rest of of the the band well well disciplined disciplined thought thought
them to to postpone postpone their their own own supper supper until until their their chief chief

squat squat man man turned turned his his head a a little little grunt rose rose and and walked walked away away
towards towards the the beach young young fellow fellow his his flute flute playing playing and and
the the other other remaining remaining to to watch watch the the stew heard heard a a canoe canoe grate grate
lightly lightly on on the the gravel a a few few words words exchanged rolled rolled over over on on his his side
and and saw towards towards could could be be no no that that
huge huge form looking looking more more gigantic gigantic than than ever ever as as it it over over the the
prostrate prostrate lad

features it it was was unusually unusually handsome handsome for for an an there there was was an an
inhuman inhuman hardness hardness about about it a a fiercely fiercely piercing piercing quality quality in in the the eyes cruel cruel
lines lines about about nostrils nostrils and and lips a a general general expression expression of of bitter bitter and and
vindictive vindictive malevolence malevolence that that the the boy shudder shudder passed passed through through
him yet fascinated he he could could not not take take his his eyes eyes from from the the dark piercing piercing
ones

spoke and and a a start start of of surprise was was not not the the words words
that that amazed amazed him the the said said was are are you white white man
come come you you simple simple question question in in curiously curiously accented accented was was
the the voice voice that that surprised surprised high high pitched almost almost such such
a a voice voice as as the the boy boy had had never never heard heard in in an an before it it was was
incongruous incongruous with with the the size size and and appearance appearance of of the the evil evil giant
the the spell spell in in which which had had held held him him was was broken great great
was was the the revulsion revulsion of of feeling feeling that that actually actually wanted wanted to to laugh
he he that that to to take take any any notice notice of of the the weak weak point point would would
surely surely arouse arouse his his hatred
controlled controlled his his features features and and steadily had had had had plenty plenty of of time time
that that long long afternoon afternoon to to plan plan the the story story he he was was to to tell

supplies supplies lost my my comrade comrade rather rather surprised surprised at at the the
readiness readiness with with which which he he told told his his false false tale was was
truthful inclined inclined to to regard regard a a lie lie as as a a refuge but but he he had had no no
intention intention of of his his true true name name and and purpose purpose to to his his
enemy

to to consider consider the the reply he he spoke spoke again far far
from from he he said said in in his his bad bad was was suspicious suspicious of of the the
tale but but the the boy boy was was prepared prepared for for doubt

were were going going from from the the at at the the on on to to
explain had had sold sold our our and and had had all all our our supplies supplies for for the the winter

where where we we came came the the

was was face face closely but but he he could could not not tell tell whether whether
the the believed believed the the story story or or not or or indeed indeed how how much much of of it it he he
understood made made no no reply reply except except a a queer queer little little sound sound in in his his throat
of of his his high-pitched highpitched voice that that sound sound could could not not be be called called a a
grunt and and was was at at a a loss loss to to know know whether whether it it meant meant assent disbelief disbelief
or or contempt he he could could add add anything anything more more to to his his story the the giant giant
turned turned abruptly abruptly away walked walked over over to to the the fire fire and and seated seated himself himself on on a a
log

one one of of his his followers followers removed removed the the pot and with with a a
crudely crudely carved carved wooden wooden spoon out out a a generous generous portion portion
of of the the stew stew into into a a birch birch bark bark dish chief chief received received the the dish dish in in

passed passed the the dish dish back back to to be be

other other eight eight in in number stood stood or or sat sat about about in in silence
until until the the chief chief had had finished finished his his second second portion portion and and had had signified by by
turning turning the the empty empty dish dish upside upside down down on on the the ground that that he he had had had had enough
did did they they venture venture to to approach approach the the kettle each each with with his his own own bark bark or or wooden wooden
bowl said said something something to to the the squat squat man man who who had had been been one one of of
pointing pointing to to the the boy boy as as he he spoke once once the the man carrying carrying his his
own own dish dish of of stew over over to to the the captive seated seated himself himself cross-legged
beside beside him up up a a piece piece of of meat meat on on the the point point of of his his knife knife and and held held it it

way way to to get get you you away away before before nightfall and and they they might might carry carry you you
off off somewhere somewhere in in a a canoe canoe where where could could not not follow

to to the the beach beach and and hid hid myself myself in in the the near near the the big big
saw saw and and six six others others go go away their their
that that two two were were the the others others and and small small canoe canoe was was
left left on on the the beach had had been been gone gone a a while heard heard
and and two two more more men men came came along along the the shore shore from from the the camp carried carried a a net net of of
cedar cedar cord had had an an ugly ugly face face and and a a red red band band around around his his head
other a a short strong strong man at at once is is an an one one
of of the the two two who who helped helped to to escape two two sat sat down down on on the the sand sand
just just below below where where was was hidden and and nearer nearer to to listen listen to to what what
they they said said as as they they their their net spoke spoke has has not not
been been with with long asked asked what what the the chief chief would would do do with with the the white white
captive name name means means the the that that would would
take take the the white white man man to to the the mainland to to the the of of but but they they
could could not not start start today because because the the wind wind was was too too strong strong and and the the lake lake too too
rough was was not not pleased said said he he wished wished the the chief chief would would let let
the the white white men men alone alone until until his his people people were were stronger said said that that
hated hated all all white white men the the trader trader escaped escaped his his


interrupted interrupted said said trader trader

the the trader trader escaped escaped vengeance the the chief chief
to to kill kill every every white white man man who who fell fell into into his his

what what did did he he mean mean by by

was was as as we we his his voice voice low low and and tense was was
who who brought brought our our father father to to his his death said said it it was was true true
that that escaped but but in in his his escape escape he he received received his his death death

what what we we found found at at the the

what what they they said said it it seems seems that that our our father father and and both both
fell fell into into hands some some way way they they escaped but but they they were were
overtaken overtaken at at the the of of and and our our father father
away away again but but sorely sorely wounded is is the the way way put put together together the the things things
heard heard the the two two men men

comes comes it it then then that that the the bateau bateau and and are are here here on on
bring bring them them

think think knows knows nothing nothing of of the the we we first first saw saw him him here here
thought thought he he had had come come to to to to seek seek the the but but no this this is is not not the the
first first time time he he has has been been here call call him him of of
think think he he fled fled here he he and and and and the the other other man man who who helped helped him when when
he he escaped escaped from from our our father father and and the the know know not not when when the the rest rest of of
the the band band joined joined him but but believe believe and and those those two two were were living living
somewhere somewhere on on this this island island when when white white men men and and red red sought sought them them and and could could not not
find find them know here here on on our our father father and and
said said it it was was strange strange that that two two white white men men had had been been
found found here where where no no man man was was believed believed to to come and and the the
new new white white captive captive pretended pretended to to be be only only he he said and and told told tales tales
of of how how they they were were driven driven here here by by storm storm and and wrecked wrecked on on the the rocks chief chief
believed believed story but but now now that that this this other other white white man man came came with with the the
same same tale to to doubt thought thought perhaps perhaps they they came came to to spy spy on on


did did not not believe believe it it made made
little little difference difference what what story story told he he all all white white men men and and
to to destroy destroy them them and and drive drive them them out out of of this this country thinks thinks he he
is is destined destined to to be be some some sort sort of of king king over over this this part part of of the the world
those those two two say say more more of of

their their net net was was finished finished and and they they out out in in the the little little canoe
once once sought sought you my my brother but but not not cut cut your your bonds two two
were were only only a a little little way way out out in in the the bay listened listened to to them them talk talk
again could could not not get get the the meaning meaning of of all all they they said but but think think
to to hold hold a a council council on on that that island island where where he he his his
am am sure sure that that others others are are to to meet meet him him there there to to join join his his

he he was was me me to to be be put put to to death death by by torture torture as as a a sort sort of of
entertainment entertainment for for his his new new grimly
is is not not the the part part in in the the performance performance should should choose choose to to play
can can find find some some other other part part more more to to my my daring daring suggestion suggestion had had
come come into into his his mind mind as as told told of of the the council council on on the the of of
you you learn learn when when the the meeting meeting was was to to asked asked
abruptly

is is to to be be soon think wait wait only only for for safe safe weather weather to to make make the the


was was silent silent in in frowning frowning thought he he spoke it it was was not not of of the the
council is is plain plain to to see see what what he he said said musingly storm storm
bore bore father father and and his his comrade comrade here here to to this this island boat boat was was driven driven
into into that that crack crack in in the the rocks rocks and and wrecked came came upon upon them
them them captive captive and and carried carried them them to to the the mainland must must have have had had some some
warning though for for he he hid hid the the and and the the packet wonder
if when when he he was was first first wrecked he he put put the the up up on on that that rock rock shelf shelf to to
keep keep them them dry dry and and safe afterwards when when he he learned learned was was
near he he moved moved the the to to a a more more secret secret spot spot farther farther from from the the

were were right right all all the the added believing believing that that had had
something something to to do do with with

moment moment later following following closely said said anxiously are are leaving leaving
a a plain plain trail trail here ground ground is is damp damp and and there there is is much much

cannot cannot help help that we we must must leave leave a a trail we we will will use use it it to to lead lead
our our astray as as lightly lightly as as you you can and and in in a a little little while while
will will show show you you a a had had been been possessed possessed with with the the fear fear that that some some
of of men men might might have have discovered discovered the the boat boat and and taken taken it it away was was
greatly greatly relieved relieved to to find find it it tied tied to to the the overhanging overhanging tree tree where where he he had had
left left it

the the the the younger younger boy boy ordered paddle paddle down down to to the the place place
where where we we came came out out of of the the woods will will join join you you

are are you you going going to to

our our astray they they find find my my tracks tracks near near their their camp camp and and
follow follow them they they may may also also find find the the trail trail down down to to this this place must must
not not think think that that we we crossed crossed the the water water from from here shall shall make make tracks plain plain
tracks from from here here down down towards towards the the mouth mouth of of the the bay beyond beyond the the place place
where where you you and and came came out out of of the the woods woods a a little little while while

in in our our old old trail trail from from here here to to the the ridge ridge top top the the point point up
not not

and and we we have have not not time time to to go go back back and and make make new hope hope they they will will
think think we we both both ways ways on on that that trail will will go go back back a a little little way way
and and make make a a few few leading leading

was was untying untying and and pushing pushing off off the the bateau going going
carefully carefully and and lightly for for a a little little way way the the route route he he had had taken taken
when when he he in in search search of of his his white white brother turning he he came came back
leaving leaving here here and and there there clear clear to to show show direction or or
thirty thirty feet feet from from the the shore he he branched branched off off to to the the left making making tracks tracks
leading leading to to the the trail but but avoiding avoiding the the spot spot where where the the bateau bateau
lay then then on on towards towards the the mouth mouth of of the the bay carefully carefully obliterating obliterating
all all toe toe marks marks that that pointed pointed up up the the channel and and making making sure sure to to leave leave some some
pointing pointing down

the the meantime meantime had had pushed pushed off off the the bateau noticed noticed that that the the boat boat
had had left left no no clear clear traces except except where where the the rope rope had had the the bark bark from from
the the limb limb around around which which it it had had been been tied scar scar might might easily easily have have been been
made made by by the the claws claws of of some some animal animal climbing climbing out out over over the the water make make
such such an an origin origin seem seem more more likely he he the the scar scar lengthwise lengthwise several several
times times with with his his thumb thumb nail he he along along close close to to shore he he came came
upon upon the the tree tree had had crossed crossed on and and pushed pushed it it out out into into mid mid channel

a a hundred hundred feet feet below below the the place place where where they they had had come come out out of of the the
woods joined joined they they pains pains to to leave leave distinct distinct signs signs
that that a a boat boat had had been been pulled pulled up up on on shore wished wished their their to to
see see that that they they had had taken taken to to the the water water at at this this spot intention intention was was to to
lead lead should should he he find find their their trail away away from from the the island island where where the the
were were hidden

it it be be possible load load the the and and
start start across across the the lake lake at at once the the wind wind is is right am am willing willing to to risk risk
seeing seeing us us and and giving giving chase a a good good breeze breeze we we can can
his his

shook shook his his head could could not not run run away away from from him him in in this this wind
night night it it was was nearly nearly northeast but but now now it it is is northwest you you
noticed noticed that that when when we we were were on on the the ridge ridge top cannot cannot make make speed speed with with
this this heavy heavy bateau bateau against against the the wind it it is is not not too too strong strong for for
to to go go against against it if if the the men men at at the the have have skill we we must must wait wait
till till the the wind wind changes changes or or till till darkness darkness comes comes again we we will will carry carry our our
false false trail trail

the the boat boat straight straight across across the the channel channel to to the the outer outer end end of of
the the opposite opposite island steep high bare bare masses masses of of detached detached rock rock
and and the the small small island island itself a a reef reef extended the the inner inner end end rising rising out out of of
the the water water to to form form a a beach beach of of and and pebbles the the
bateau bateau on on the the pebbles pebbles and and out could could see see off off across across the the open open
water water to to the the east where where the the sun sun was was already already above above the the horizon

said said will will leave leave the the ashes ashes of of a a fire as as if if we we had had
stopped stopped to to cook cook a a meal haste haste and and get get

did did not not need need to to be be warned warned to to make make haste small small fire fire was was soon soon
on on the the pebbles pebbles where where it it could could not not spread then then partly partly stamped stamped out out
and and left left the the again back back to to
satisfy satisfy himself himself that that the the wind wind was was not not carrying carrying any any sparks sparks towards towards the the
woods he he had had always always drenched drenched his his cooking cooking fire fire before before leaving leaving
camp but but to to have have water water on on this this one one would would have have defeated defeated his his
younger younger purpose wanted wanted the the recent recent kindling kindling of of the the fire fire
to to be be in in plain plain evidence

we we have have gone gone from from here here our our cannot cannot he he
will will find find no no tracks tracks or or signs signs on on this this little little island island except except around around
the the fire they they will will be be sure sure we we have have gone gone by by boat but but which which way way they they
will will not not

way way shall shall we we

to to our our camp camp in in the the little little inland inland lake but but not not down down the the channel channel
next next the the point will will steer steer around around these these big big rocks rocks and and up up the the other other
side side of of this this

two two the the bateau bateau around around the the rocks rocks and and up up along along the the southeastern southeastern
side side of of the the small small island in in the the center center and and heavily heavily wooded it it hid hid
them them completely route route led led them them into into the the open open end end of of the the narrow narrow
strait strait that that cut cut into into the the other other island island where where the the were were hidden
passed passed the the gap gap with with its its two two tiny tiny where where heretofore heretofore they they had had gone gone
in in and and out and and were were soon soon back back in in the the little little pond

know know whether whether we we are are wise wise to to stay stay said said thoughtfully
as as they they the the boat boat up up on on the the narrow narrow beach have have tried tried to to confuse confuse
our our trail yet yet if if tracks tracks us us across across the the high high ridge ridge and and down down to to the the
water he he will will surely surely search search all all these these is is almost almost too too
perfect perfect a a hiding hiding place those those are are familiar familiar with with this this of of
they they will will think think of of this this place place at at once we we shall shall be be caught caught
like like rats rats in in a a

are are right right to to call call this this the the of of
that that name name and and spoke spoke of of it think think they they have have never never
been been here here but but that that one one time what what they they said said think think they they have have always always
made made their their on on the the part part of of that that lies lies the the other other side side of of the the
high high ridge now now both both and and have have great great fear fear of of this this

has has the the mighty mighty chief chief saw saw his his fear fear in in his his
face face when when spoke spoke of of hearing hearing strange strange noises am am though if if
he he should should track track us us here if if he he will will not not suspect suspect a a

more more than than the the has has frightened frightened on
second second time time listened listened to to those those two told told of of huge huge
giants giants at at the the end end of of the the

he he mean mean those those pillars pillars of of

the the giants giants were were alive alive and and

old old superstition

said said he he saw saw the the giants he he and and others others of of the the

spent spent nearly nearly a a day day on on that that point point and and we we saw saw no no giants saw saw
anything anything there there it it must must have have been been you you and and me understand understand how how those those
fellows fellows in in that that canoe canoe could could have have seeing seeing us sudden sudden
light light of of understanding understanding in in do do you you remember remember
how how hot hot and and still still it it was and and how how the the haze haze on on the the water do do
you you recall recall the the day day we we crossed crossed to to the the the the very very same same sort sort of of
day saw saw the the mirage high high mountains mountains towering towering up up where where later later we we found found
there there were were no no real real mountains you you remember remember too too when when we we left left the the of of
the the how how we we saw saw coming coming towards towards us us through through the the morning morning mist what what
we we thought thought was was a a ship so so tall tall it it but but when when it it nearer nearer it it
to to a a mere mere

remember remember those those was was staring staring at at excited excited face

you you understand understand then you you see see how how it it was was that that and and those those
others others in in that that canoe canoe saw saw giants giants on on the the end end of of the the point that that hot
still still day as as they they came came across across the the water water and and through through the the shimmer shimmer
of of the the heat heat haze they they saw saw us us there there on on the the open open rocks ourselves ourselves saw saw
that that island island far far out out greater greater than than it it really really was was and and distorted you you
remember remember how how it it afterwards those those men men in in that that canoe canoe we we too too were were
distorted distorted and and up up huge huge and and tall tall like like giants was was what what
frightened frightened them their their hasty hasty flight were were the the giants giants on on
the the end end of of the the

was was still still staring but but his his look look of of had had given given way way to to one one
almost almost of of awe may may be be as as you you he he slowly thought thought
it it was was and and cannot cannot understand understand it it at at all that that
enchantment enchantment you you call call mirage mirage that that makes makes men men see see mountains mountains that that are are not not
there there and and turns turns into into and and men men into into

understand understand it it admitted neither neither did did the the
captain captain of of the the said said it it was was just just one one of of the the secrets secrets of of
nature nature that that we we understand understand yet the the mirage mirage is is nothing nothing to to
fear has has stood stood us us in in good good stead stead by by away away men men and and
causing causing them them to to stand stand in in terror terror of of this this bay wonder wonder we we them them
away away with with the the echoes must must have have been been frightened frightened when when they they came came in in
here only only their their fear fear is is strong strong enough enough to to keep keep them them away away now we we are are
safe we we dare dare not not trust trust too too much much to to that must must hide hide ourselves ourselves as as
well well as as we we can entrance entrance to to this this little little lake lake is is narrow narrow and and think think
see see a a way way to to block block it it so so it it will will look look as as if if no no boat boat could could have have gone gone
through though let let us us eat eat something something if if there there is is anything anything

is is a a little little corn if if no no animal animal has has stolen stolen
too too am am sore sore hungry for for have have eaten eaten nothing nothing but but a a few few green green
since since set set out out in in search search of of








corn in in its its bark bark wrapping was was found found untouched hanging hanging from from the the
birch birch where where had had left left it daring daring to to kindle kindle a a fire fire for for fear fear the the
smoke smoke might might betray betray them put put the the dry in in the the kettle kettle
with with cold cold water water to to soften soften them he he spoke spoke again again of of his his plan plan to to block block
the the entrance entrance to to the the pond

cedar cedar that that far far down down over over the the he he as as
if if it it was was almost almost ready ready to to fall fall of of its its own own weight we we could could pull pull or or
push push it it down it it would would go go clear clear across across that that narrow narrow

then then we we could could not not take take our our bateau bateau

we we can can easily easily chop chop out out a a section section when when we we are are ready ready to to

is is near near he he will will hear hear the the sound sound of of the the

is is better better to to risk risk that than than to to leave leave the the entrance entrance open
will will go go look look at at the the tree tree and and see see what what we we can can

leaning top-heavy topheavy cedar cedar had had tipped tipped so so far far that that several several of of its its roots roots
had had pulled pulled loose loose from from their their anchorage bringing bringing with with them them a a section section of of
the the shallow shallow soil soil and and the the rock rock below one one side side the the roots roots still still
held enough enough nourishment nourishment to to the the limbs limbs to to keep keep part part of of them them
alive of of the the thick thick of of foliage foliage were were brown brown and and dead but but many many
were were still still green green and and flourishing tree tree certainly certainly as as if if the the
slightest slightest additional additional strain strain would would tip tip it it the the rest rest of of the the way
testing testing it the the noted noted where where it it would would fall stood stood a a few few feet feet above above
the the water water and and out out at at an an angle angle across across the the passageway

will will not not catch catch in in any any tree tree when when it it goes goes observed
breaks breaks in in other other trees trees or or bushes bushes would would betray betray how how recently recently it it had had fallen
course course the the fact fact that that it it is is partly partly green green will will prove prove it it been been down down
very very

tree tree lying lying in in the the water water will will stay stay green green for for many many


think think we we had had better better try try to to push push it it decided make make a a way way
out out tonight we we shall shall not not need need to to chop chop through through the the trunk end end will will
be be high high enough enough from from the the water water so by by cutting cutting off off a a few few of of the the lower lower
limbs we we can can take take the the boat boat

the the water water is is deep deep enough enough at at this this added added

to to bring bring down down the the tree tree failed however was was
not not so so insecure insecure as as it it tough tough roots roots that that still still held held were were
stronger stronger than than the the had had suspected and and pulling pulling with with
all all their their might might had had little little effect

must must cut cut away away some some of of the the roots roots that that are are said said at at last
me me your your hatchet has has

roots roots were were tough but but the the little little was was sharp sharp and and blows blows
vigorous cut cut every every root root he he could could reach and and the the tree tree
and and tipped pulling pulling up up more more and and chunks chunks of of soil

will will come come now needs needs just just a a little little more more weight

the the hatchet upon upon the the leaning leaning trunk trunk and and made made his his way way
along along it tree tree with with the the added added weight he he farther farther up up
and and out the the strain strain on on the the few few roots roots was was too too great a a rending rending sound sound
they they up up the the shallow shallow soil and and the the cedar cedar down down across across the the
channel

had had expected expected the the tree tree to to go go suddenly and and he he kept kept a a firm firm hold but but
he he was was and and drenched drenched in in the the splash trunk where where he he was was
did did not not go go under under water and and he he scrambled scrambled quickly quickly back back to to shore
the the roots roots were were in in the the air air now and and the the tree tree down down from from the the
butt instead instead of of up crown crown rested rested in in the the shallow shallow water water and and against against

coming coming around around that that little little island island and and seeing seeing this this fallen fallen tree tree would would
guess guess there there was was a a lake lake or or bay bay in in here course course if if he he came came so so close close he he
could could peep peep through through the the he he might might be be able able to to see see water water beyond
but but he he would would never never guess guess that that a a boat boat could could go go in came came up up here
though he he would would see see the the upturned upturned earth earth and and the the cut cut ends ends of of the the
tree tree roots the the bushes bushes hide hide this this spot spot from from the the water water and and there there is is
nothing nothing to to bring bring ashore ashore here shall shall be be better better hidden hidden than than we we
could could have have

it it was was a a good good thought my my brother will will go go back back now now and and bring bring
the the bateau bateau around around to to this this side side of of the the little little lake if if looks looks

to to reply led led off off at at once back back to to the the beach beach and and
around around to to the the spot spot where where the the boat boat lay and and carefully the the
all all signs signs of of their their camp camp that that might might be be seen seen from from across across

and and rose into into the the woods woods just just beyond beyond where where the the
boat boat lay he he his his way way among among trees trees and and bushes quite quite
as as cautiously was was but but a a short short distance and and after after a a few few steps steps
dropped dropped to to his his hands hands and and knees his his example and and
motionless motionless while while the the other other ahead ahead and and behind behind a a clump clump of of


older older boy boy several several minutes then then forward the the

close close to to the the margin margin of of the the woods almost almost flat he he along along
until until he he could could see see a a patch patch of of water a a moment moment he he lay lay still looking looking
and and listening he he forward forward again again and and his his station station behind behind a a
thick thick mass mass of of cedar cedar needles its its youth youth this this cedar cedar had had been been bent bent almost almost
double double by by some some weight a a fallen fallen tree tree probably and and had had grown grown in in that that
misshapen misshapen form branching branching and and out out in in dense dense clear clear to to the the
ground around around the the green green screen found found he he was was but but a a few few feet feet
from from the the edge edge of of the the water sheltered sheltered bay bay was was without without a a ripple the the
sun sun hot the the woods woods still the the silence silence unbroken unbroken by by even even the the twitter twitter of of a a
bird bird or or the the hum hum of of an an insect

boy boy was was about about to to raise raise himself himself for for a a better better view when from from the the
water a a sound sound came came to to his his ears very very slightest slightest of of sounds sounds it it was but but
he he lowered lowered his his head head a a little little farther farther back back behind behind
the the cedar cedar masses masses and and lay lay motionless sound sound came came again the the slightest slightest
suggestion suggestion of of water the the bay bay was was smooth smooth and and still he he
heard heard was was the the of of a a paddle paddle blade the the ripple ripple of of water water against against the the
side side of of a a boat

a a few few moments moments not not try try to to look curiosity curiosity the the
better better of of fear his his head head ever ever so so little he he found found a a peephole
between between the the cedar cedar and and put put his his eye eye to to it could could see see a a bit bit of of the the
round wooded wooded islet a a section section of of the the shore shore opposite opposite and on on the the water water
between a a birch birch canoe held held three three men bowman was was the the tall tall young young
who who had had first first taken taken prisoner man man in in the the middle middle a a
red red band band about about his his long long black black hair the the canoe canoe came came nearer could could
see see that that the the steersman steersman was was the the squat squat from from whose whose custody custody he he had had
escaped had had not not killed killed the the guard guard then but but no no doubt doubt some some heavy heavy
punishment punishment hung hung over over head head if if he he did did not not find find and and bring bring him him
back was was desperate desperate enough enough to to dare dare return return to to the the of of


canoe canoe came came slowly the the man man in in the the bow bow the the water was was
shallow shallow between between the the round round islet islet and and the the blocked blocked entrance entrance to to the the little little
pond the the fallen fallen cedar cedar deceive deceive the the or or not held held his his
breath

bowman straightened straightened a a little towards towards the the cedar then then
back back at at the the water water again eyes eyes were were on on his his paddle head head
turned turned from from side side to to side as as he he the the shore shore and and the the woods woods for for any any
sign sign that that the the fugitive fugitive had had been been there glance glance swept swept the the barrier
twisted twisted his his paddle canoe canoe nearer nearer to to the the blocked blocked passage

man man in in the the bow bow uttered uttered a a sharp sharp hiss hiss of of warning an an instant instant
that that the the fellow fellow had had caught caught sight sight of of him him through through the the leafy leafy screen
the the warning warning was was of of shallows shallows ahead steersman steersman dipped dipped his his paddle paddle
and and the the canoe canoe again this this time time away away from from the the fallen fallen cedar did did
not not cast cast another another glance glance in in that that direction as as the the canoe canoe came came on on past past the the
barrier as as had had called called it was was out water water was was at at its its
lowest lowest point point of of fluctuation one one could could suspect suspect a a navigable navigable channel channel
where where the the tree tree lay

was was plain plain that that the the intended intended to to round round the the little little islet do do
so so they they must must pass pass close close to to the the shore shore where where was lowered lowered his his head head
cautiously cautiously and and lay lay prone prone and and motionless could could hear hear the the gentle gentle ripple ripple
of of the the water water as as the the canoe canoe through through it a a harsh harsh voice voice spoke
close close it it that that the the lad lad almost almost and and a a shudder shudder of of fear fear
passed passed through through him an an instant instant he he that that the the voice voice was was
and and that that it it came came from from the the water not not from from the the land tall tall fellow fellow
briefly and and an an abrupt abrupt rejoinder they they said said
could could not not guess for for they they spoke spoke in in

slight slight sounds sounds of of and and water water and and
then then a a long long breath raised raised his his head head a a little little
and and through through the the peephole canoe canoe was was no no longer longer in in sight
could could not not be be far far away though so so he he lay lay still was was just just
whether whether it it would would be be safe safe now now to to try try for for another another and and view view of of the the bay bay
and and strait and and had had raised raised his his head head to to reconnoiter when when he he caught caught sight sight
of of a a crouching crouching figure figure slipping slipping swiftly swiftly between between the the trees trees towards towards him
an an instant instant his his heart heart to to stop stop beating then then he he saw saw that that it it was was
approaching

younger younger brother brother dropped dropped down down beside beside the the elder are are he he
whispered us us go go








canoe canoe had had gone gone by but but the the did did not not abate abate their their caution caution and and
watchfulness watchfulness one one whit as as they they made made their their way way back back to to the the shore shore of of the the
pond

danger danger seems seems to to be be his his voice voice still still lowered lowered to to
a a whisper as as he he came came out out of of the the woods woods near near the the boat could could you you
understand understand what what those those two two said you you near near enough enough to to

was was but but a a little little way way beyond beyond you my my brother heard heard every every word
is is bad bad blood blood between between and and the the young young was was the the
who who wished wished to to come come up up this this way found found the the ashes ashes of of our our fire fire at at the the
end end of of that that island island out out there thinks thinks we we on on across across the the mouth mouth of of
this this long long bay wished wished to to seek seek us us in in that that direction but but when when the the
found found the the passage passage between between these these he he forced forced to to come come
up up here here first is is sure sure now now that that we we are are not not in in here they they go go the the way way


we we are are safe safe from from those those three three for for some some hours hours at at least but but wish wish we we
where where and and the the others others

must must hold hold and and perhaps perhaps the the to to blame blame for for your your
escape they they take take you you not not back it it will will go go hard hard with with them may may be be
that that has has sent sent them them to to seek seek you you and and himself himself waits waits at at the the camp or or
he he may may search search in in the the other other direction he he will will not not come come into into this this
of of at at

likely likely he he is is glad glad of of an an excuse excuse to to stay stay with with a a
grin may may be be brave brave as as a a lion lion with with other other men but but think think he he is is
not not quite quite so so bold bold with with

man man simply am am not not sure sure that that is is very very
brave is is cruel cruel and and treacherous but but brave brave in in the the way way our our father father was
think think he he is is not not brave brave like like lad lad one one of of his his
characteristic characteristic

made made no no answer his his opinion opinion of of
somewhat was was half half of of the the stock and and the the ancient ancient
hatred hatred between between and and had had not not out out and and probably probably never never
would would die boy boy was was naturally naturally unwilling unwilling to to admit admit any any good good qualities qualities in in
the the self-styled of of half half by by blood blood and and wholly wholly so so by by
training thought thought must must have have some some unusual unusual qualities
since in in spite spite of of the the ancient ancient hate he he had had to to his his band band
as as well well as as

we we know know on on after after a a moment near near the the others others
may may be or or how how soon soon may may return return this this way dare dare not not venture venture out out
until until darkness darkness

two two carried carried them them to to the the shore shore and and them them in in the the boat more more they they
across across the the lake lake and and the the sail sail aboard did did not not set set up up the the
mast as as they they wished wished to to push push the the boat boat under under the the fallen fallen cedar
the the bateau bateau close close to to the the end end of of the the barrier they they set set to to work work to to cut cut a a way way

the the tree tree to to reach reach the the limbs limbs he he wished wished to to cut standing standing in in the the
shallow shallow water trimmed trimmed off off smaller smaller with with his his stout stout knife
with with skill skill and and speed they they soon soon had had the the lower lower limbs limbs cleared cleared away away from from the the
under under side side of of the the trunk to to be be room room enough enough to to push push the the
bateau bateau through but but the the water water at at that that spot spot was was very very shallow boat boat
grounded grounded on on the the rock rock bottom unloaded unloaded most most of of the the and and
in in dragging dragging the the bateau bateau over over the the shallows they they
had had to to carry carry the the through through the the woods and and this this work work they they
were were forced forced to to do do as as quietly quietly as as possible blows blows of of the the could could not not
be be muffled but but the the two two made made no no noise noise they they could could avoid did did not not dare dare
light light a a torch but but the the sky sky was was clear clear and and the the northern northern twilight twilight long
had had settled settled down however by by the the time time they they were were ready ready to to leave leave
their their island island of of refuge

that that sheltered sheltered place they they were were unable unable to to tell tell whether whether there there was was
breeze breeze enough enough to to aid aid or or hinder hinder them but but they they had had made made up up their their minds minds to to
leave leave the the of of possible possible they they would would start start for for the the mainland
by by sail sail if if they they could by by paddle paddle if if they they must the the wind wind was was so so strong strong
against against them them that that they they could could not not cross they they would would go go on on in in the the other other
direction and and find find some some temporary temporary hiding hiding place place farther farther from from the the camp camp of of

the the black wooded wooded masses masses of of the the to to right right and and left they they
and and still still water water made made the the shallows shallows treacherous but but they they had had
noted noted the the channel channel on on their their way way in in that that morning and and made made their their way way out out
again again without without accident

in in the the bow bow a a quick low low hiss that that the the
alarmed alarmed warning warning meant not not mere mere shallow shallow water water ahead but but some some graver graver
danger obeyed obeyed the the signal signal and and into into the the deep deep shadow shadow of of the the
island island close close by boat boat scraped scraped the the rocks rocks and and came came to to a a stop

not not been been a a mild mild man yet yet it it was was not not so so much much the the

as as hated hated the the giant giant he he something something different different
and and alien alien in in his his passion the the of of constant constant
association association with with had had to to think think of of him him as as
but but now for for the the moment he he was was not not but but
it it was was the the white white boy boy who who was was the the most most impatient impatient at at
the the thought thought of of delay delay in in dealing dealing with with

wind however had had apparently apparently settled settled the the question breeze breeze would would
carry carry the the boat boat northwest northwest to to but but would would be be more more hindrance hindrance than than
help help in in going going southwest southwest to to the the lee lee of of an an island the the
raised raised their their mast mast and and up up their their sail they they out out
from from shelter the the breeze breeze caught caught the the canvas canvas and and they they were were off off across across the the
lake

had had covered covered the the moon and and it it was was too too dark dark to to sight sight
could could do do nothing nothing but but run run before before the the wind wind and and trust trust to to it it to to
carry carry them them somewhere somewhere near near their their destination any any rate rate they they were were
leaving leaving and and putting putting the the between between themselves themselves and and the the cruel
self-appointed chief chief of of the the island wonderful wonderful and and beautiful beautiful island
which which the the white white men men had had appropriately appropriately called called deserved deserved a a better better
king and and the the first first step step in in the the right right direction direction was was to to depose depose the the present present
usurper thought thought with with grim grim humor








the the light light breeze breeze the the bateau bateau but but slowly and and the the in in their their
impatience to to increase increase speed speed by by helping helping with with the the they they
farther farther out however the the wind wind increased and and before before long long they they laid laid
aside aside the the satisfied satisfied that that they they were were making making fairly fairly good good progress

the the stars stars dimly the the south south and and east the the sky sky was was
with with masses masses of of cloud that that way felt felt uneasy rainstorm
coming coming down down upon upon the the heavily heavily loaded open open bateau bateau would would be be unpleasant unpleasant if if
not not disastrous the the behavior behavior of of the the sail he he that that the the wind wind was was
less less steady the the past past two two months months he he had had learned learned something something of of the the
moods moods of of and and he he understood understood that that he he must must be be ready ready for for a a
sudden sudden shift had had been been handling handling both both sheet sheet and and tiller but but now now he he
turned turned the the steering steering over over to to his his brother

change change of of wind wind came came suddenly suddenly and and with with force a a few few moments moments
had had his his hands hands full obeyed obeyed orders orders on on the the instant sail sail and and boat boat
were were about and and were were soon soon running running freely freely before before the the wind wind again

may may not not reach reach the the so so soon soon as as we we
when when the the momentary momentary danger danger was was past wind wind seems seems to to be be taking taking us us where where
it it chooses near near as as can can tell tell we we must must be be running running almost almost directly directly west west
now now instead instead of of

up up at at the the only only patch patch of of clear clear sky sky visible think think we we
go go west the the wind wind holds holds steady steady we we shall shall reach reach the the shore shore somewhere somewhere
between between the the and and the the it it shifts shifts
broke broke off off with with a a shrug

it it shifts shifts up up the the words shall shall reach reach somewhere somewhere
sometime unless unless we we go go to to the the bottom that that would would be be a a better better fate fate
than than falling falling into into

breeze breeze was was increasing increasing in in force the the waves waves running running ever ever higher
and and were were kept kept busy busy and and alert the the wind the the bateau bateau was was
sailing sailing swiftly swiftly enough enough so so that that there there was was little little danger danger of of following following seas seas
actually actually it but heavily heavily laden it it low with with little little
buoyancy time time it it pitched pitched down down into into the the trough trough of of the the waves waves it it
water were were the the dangerous dangerous moments the the utmost utmost care care in in
handling handling sail sail and and rudder the the could could do do little little to to insure insure against against
disaster keep keep straight straight before before the the wind not not to to lose lose control control of of sail sail
or or rudder and and to to take take the the chances chances with with coolness coolness and and composure composure was was about about
all all there there was was to to do they they drove drove on on in in the the darkness now now riding riding high high on on
the the summit summit of of a a wave now now pitching pitching down down between between walls walls of of water they they lost lost
all all count count of of time

waves waves to to be be out out a a little they they were were less less
high high and and long yet yet they they were were even even more more troublesome for for they they had had grown grown
choppy choppy and and uneven straight straight with with them found found the the
sail sail swinging swinging around he he directly directly before before the the wind the the boat boat
pitched pitched at at an an angle angle with with the the waves

wind wind has has he he said said anxiously

comes comes from from the the northeast northeast

were were too too busy busy and and anxious anxious to to talk confined confined his his speech speech to to
sharply sharply given given orders orders and and to to answering answering spray spray of of
breaking breaking waves waves them them both time time and and again boat boat was was shipping shipping a a
good good deal deal of of water but but was was impossible elder elder brother brother had had his his
hands hands full full with with the the sail the the younger younger was was compelled compelled to to give give all all his his
attention attention to to steering

conditions conditions improved wind wind steadied steadied and and the the waves waves obeyed obeyed it
more more the the bateau bateau could could ride ride them them straight while while running running directly directly
before before the the breeze clouds clouds were were broken broken now moving moving swiftly swiftly across across the the
sky covering covering and and the the moon moon and and stars the the
to to take take their their eyes eyes from from sail sail and and water they they upward enough enough
sky sky had had been been blown blown clean clean to to show show them them the the position position of of the the moon moon and and
principal principal stars both both were were surprised surprised to to learn learn that that dawn dawn was was not not
nearer to to them them that that they they had had been been pitching pitching about about in in the the waves waves
for for a a very very long long time yet yet the the day day was was still still hours hours away

wind wind continued continued strong the the waves waves were were higher higher than than ever but but the the
had had more more confidence confidence in in the the sailing sailing qualities qualities of of the the boat boat
and and in in their their own own ability ability to to handle handle it water water was was being being and and
by by when when they they had had a a chance they they managed managed to to keep keep it it from from rising rising
too too high that that the the sky sky was was clearing clearing and and there there was was more more light light on on the the
lake they they could could see see farther farther across across it the the boat boat rose rose to to the the top top of of a a
wave said said suddenly du du

quickly quickly and before before the the bateau bateau pitched pitched down down between between the the
waves he he caught caught a a glimpse glimpse of of a a compact abrupt black black mass mass towering towering from from
the the water water not not many many to to his his right to to be be no no chance chance of of
reaching reaching the the mouth mouth of of the the though turn turn and and run run in in past past
the the south south side side of of was was out out of of the the question square square sail sail
would would be be worse worse than than useless and and the the laden laden bateau bateau would would inevitably inevitably be be
swamped swamped in in the the trough trough of of the the waves

stars stars were were waning waning in in the the paling paling sky short short summer summer night night was was
drawing drawing to to a a close close and and dawn dawn was was approaching and and west west of of
and and nearer nearer at at hand lower lower lines lines of of shore shore the the chain chain of of
from from one one of of which which the the had had set set out out for for the the
across across several several of of heaving heaving water were were still still too too far far away away
to to be be and and waves waves were were carrying carrying the the bateau bateau by sun
coming coming up up in in an an almost almost clear clear sky found found the the boat boat still still running running southwest southwest
on on a a course course almost almost parallel parallel with with the the unattainable unattainable chain chain of of

the the hours hours passed the the were were to to discover discover that that they they were were
drawing drawing gradually gradually nearer nearer and and nearer nearer to to the the on on the the right was was
still still better they they were were bearing bearing straight straight towards towards land land ahead continuous
high high land land they they must must be be the the main main shore that that they they must must
reach reach the the mainland mainland not not many many to to the the southwest southwest of of the the place place where where the the
chain chain of of from from it had had long long since since to to be be
particular particular where where he he landed if if it it was was only only in in some some spot spot where where food food might might
be be the the day day before before had had been been very very scanty and and he he was was
exceedingly exceedingly hungry

wind wind was was strong strong but but steady the the waves waves long long and and high bateau as as
it it plunged plunged down down into into the the trough continued continued to to ship ship a a little little water but but
the the kept kept it it down down by by when when a a hand hand and and arm arm could could be be spared
were were borne borne nearer nearer and and nearer nearer to to the the land they they past past a a group group
of of small small not not more more than than a a half half mile mile distant with with a a larger larger and and
higher higher island island showing showing beyond beyond them that that way way and and considered considered
trying trying to to turn

his his thought mainland mainland is is not not far far he he
said we we go go straight straight towards towards it us us go go on on until until we we can can land land
without without danger danger to to the the will will be be more more chance chance to to find find food food on on the the
mainland mainland

of of the the younger younger arguments arguments had had weight weight with with up up the the
idea idea of of to to turn and and they they on on with with wind wind and and waves the the
end end of of another another hour hour they they were were bearing bearing down down upon upon an an irregular rocky rocky
point

that that island island or or mainland do do you you

was was the the unhesitating unhesitating reply remember remember the the place not not
passed passed it it three three times times in in the the last last two two

made made no no answer himself himself must must have have passed passed that that spot spot twice twice within within
two two months but but there there were were so so many many rocky rocky points points along along the the shore was was
observing observing enough enough in in the the white white way but but he he did did not not see see how how

nights suddenly an an overpowering overpowering weariness weariness and and weakness weakness came came over over
him legs legs almost almost collapsed collapsed under under him dropped dropped down down on on the the beach
too too utterly utterly exhausted exhausted to to move was was on on solid solid land land again but but he he could could
scarcely scarcely realize realize it head head was was dizzy and and the the moment moment his his eyes eyes closed closed

the the shadows shadows could could tell tell that that the the sun sun was was on on its its downward downward journey
had had several several hours was was just just gathering gathering up up his his courage courage to to get get up
when when he he heard heard a a stone stone rattling rattling down down the the rock rock hill hill behind behind him his his
head he he saw saw descending boy boy was was carrying carrying several several fish fish strung strung
on on a a withe eyed eyed those those fish fish with with hungry hungry eyes could could almost almost eat eat
them them raw he he thought to to his his feet feet and and around around for for fuel
until until he he had had a a fire fire impatient impatient to to let let it it burn burn down down to to
coals coals or or to to wait wait for for water water to to holding holding a a piece piece of of fish fish on on a a
stick stick before before the the blaze did did he he ask ask his his younger younger brother brother where where he he
had had been

for for a a admitted not not for for long hunger hunger was was
too too great my my gun gun and and my my line line and and to to the the top top of of the the point
along along the the steep steep cliff but but found found no no game game and and no no tracks
came came to to that that rocky rocky bay are are steep steep there there and and the the water water clear
out out upon upon a a rock rock and and caught caught these these fish are are not not big but but they they
are are better better than than no no

certainly certainly agreed agreed wholeheartedly

elder elder pride pride in in his his own own strength strength and and endurance endurance was was humbled
had had exhausted for for hours while while the the half-breed halfbreed boy nearly nearly
three three years years younger younger than than himself had had walked walked two two or or three three in in search search
of of food

no no eatable eatable morsel morsel of of the the fish fish the the thoughts thoughts
turned turned to to their their next next move

are are far far nearer nearer the the than than the the said said
thoughtfully had had better better follow follow my my first first plan plan and and go go down down the the shore shore
instead instead of of up can can surely surely find find others others at at the the willing willing to to go go
with with us us against against

is is all all we we can can we we wait wait here here for for the the wind wind
to to change is is almost almost from from the the north north now must must go go against against it it if if we we
go go up up the the of of other other way the the shore shore will will shelter shelter us
we we cannot cannot start start yet must must wait wait a a little little for for the the waves waves to to go go

in in the the meantime meantime we we will will seek seek more more added not not try try

the the shelter shelter of of the the shore was was out out of of the the question and and
the the laden laden bateau bateau would would be be slow slow work but but was was too too impatient impatient to to delay delay
longer and and more more than than willing willing to to go go on

stopped stopped suddenly suddenly with with a a low low exclamation elder elder brother brother over over
the the shoulder the the trees trees ahead ahead the the yellow yellow light light of of
a a small small fire

here here a a whispered he he forward forward among among the the
trees

a a few few minutes minutes he he was was back back again are are three three he he said
by by a a fire a a white white man man and and two two of of the the
know know and and he he our our father need need not not fear but but because because of of the the white white
man we we will will say say nothing nothing of of the the

two two forward forward almost almost noiselessly but in in spite spite of of their their quiet quiet
approach when when they they came came out out of of the the woods woods by by the the fire one one of of the the
and and sat sat up



second second was was awake awake now both both gazing gazing
at at the the

white white man man rolled rolled over but but before before he he could could speak towards towards
him him with with a a cry cry of of pleasure it it is is good good to to see see you come come
you you

and and might might ask ask that that of of you you the the
astonished astonished for for you you at at the the but but the the
men men at at the the fort fort nothing nothing of of you said said you you were were with with your your
brother brother one one man man remembered remembered seeing seeing him him with with a a white white man
was was all all could could learn was was sore sore afraid afraid some some evil evil had had you

inland inland to to winter was was a a man man at at the the a a like like myself
who who wanted wanted sorely sorely to to go go to to the the has has wife wife and and child child
there and and the the mate mate of of the the sloop sloop brought brought him him word word that that the the child child was was very very
sick as as have have neither neither wife wife nor nor child child and and am am in in no no haste let let him him
have have my my place am am returning returning by by canoe with with and and

the the mention mention of of their their names the the two two gravely gravely towards towards
and and repeated repeated their their

camp camp here here until until the the wind wind goes goes

the the explanation had had been been doing doing some some rapid rapid
thinking thinking and and had had come come to to a a decision for for a a simple
honest truehearted fellow one one of of his his had had
already already expressed expressed confidence

asked asked abruptly you you ever ever heard heard of of the the


was was a a fierce fierce grunt grunt from from one one of of the the black black eyes eyes of of both both
were were fixed fixed on on

promptly great great a a villain villain as as ever ever


you you like like to to help help get get him him

to to his his feet was was evident evident he he had had understood understood something something of of
what what had had said he he fiercely fiercely in in bad bad is is
the the

is is an an island island down down the the on of of
calls calls it where where he he and and his his band band take take their their and and
torture torture them them to to death soon soon he he is is to to hold hold a a sort sort of of council council


know know you you interrupted

shall shall have have to to tell tell you you the the whole whole turned turned to to his his
shall shall we we tell tell them them all can can trust


you you think think best my my

on on a a log log by by the the fire fire at at the the edge edge of of the the woods while while the the
moonlight moonlight flooded flooded the the bay bay beyond related related his his strange strange tale tale to to the the
amazed amazed and and excited excited and and the the intent the the
other other also also watched watched and and listened but but it it was was evident evident
from from his his face face that that he he understood understood little little or or nothing nothing of of what what was was said
made made few few he he told told the the story story of of the the search search for for the the
hidden hidden the the with with and and his his band the the capture capture and and
escape and and what what had had learned learned from from the the
between between and and the the with with the the red red head head band did did not not
mention however the the packet packet he he carried carried under under his his shirt nor nor did did he he say say
where where he he and and had had left left the the bateau bateau and and the the
details details were were not not essential essential to to the the story and and might might as as well well be be omitted

know know now now it it was was through through father father was was the the boy boy
we and and intend intend that that the the shall shall pay pay the the
penalty penalty for for his his crime has has other other evil evil deeds deeds to to pay pay for for as as well and and
that that all long long as as he he is is at at liberty he he is is a a menace menace to to white white man man
and and peaceable peaceable alike calls calls himself himself of of and and he he has has
an an ambition ambition to to be be a a sort sort of of savage savage king is is swollen swollen with with vanity vanity and and
belief belief in in his his own own greatness and and he he seems seems to to be be a a natural natural leader leader of of men
with with a a sort sort of of uncanny uncanny influence influence over over those those he he about about him
moment moment you you think think him him ridiculous but but the the next next you you are are not not sure sure he he is is not not
a a great great man he he in in gathering gathering a a really really strong strong band band he he can can do do
serious serious

a a grunt grunt of of assent and and emphatically must must
be be the the latter latter said

or or destroyed like like the the wolf wolf he he grimly have have
a a plan and and

nearly nearly an an hour hour longer the the five five sat sat by by the the fire fire in in
and and plan a a decision decision each each
rolled rolled himself himself in in his his blanket blanket for for a a few few sleep

plan plan into into operation operation until until the the party party on on the the island island had had and and drunk drunk
and and were were sleeping coming coming storm however threatened threatened to to thwart thwart his his
strategy weather weather might might drive drive and and his his band band to to the the mainland mainland in in
search search of of better better shelter if if they they on on the the island a a violent violent
storm storm would would delay delay action daylight daylight he he could could not not carry carry out out his his scheme
and and dawn dawn was was not not far far off was was grave grave risk risk in in acting acting now but but to to
delay delay might might mean mean to to lose lose all all chance chance of of success the the lightning lightning
more more the the thunder thunder rolled rolled louder louder and and at at a a
interval must must act act now now if if at at all put put his his mouth mouth to to his his younger younger
ear

must must get get those those storm storm may may spoil spoil our our chance dare dare not not


agreed agreed understood understood the the situation situation quite quite as as well well as as
was was no no need need for for more more than than the the one one word

and and and and will will on we we get get across
must must remain remain with with our our canoe others others must must stay stay here here to to stop stop the the men men
from from the the when when they they

again and and rose rose to to his his feet he he said said
briefly briefly to to the the

a a few few whispered whispered words to to that that he he and and
must must remain remain where where they they were was was inclined inclined to to grumble
did did not not like like the the idea idea of of the the going going into into action action without without his his support
was was firm however and and as as the the whole whole plan plan was was his he he was was by by right right
the the leader so so was was forced forced to to submit the the time time had had
finished finished his his explanation and and had had the the canoe canoe in in the the water

as as as as leader his his place place in in the the bow a a flash flash of of lightning lightning
up up the the sky moment moment the the flash flash was was over the the canoe canoe was was off
in in the the center center and and in in the the stern was was left left to to the the
his his blade blade only only now now and and then then on on one one side side or or the the
other as as a a signal signal to to the the steersman

natural natural clearing where where the the fire fire now now blazed blazed bright was was at at the the other other
end end of of the the little little island the the were were all all gathered gathered around around the the
fire they they could could not not see see the the canoe canoe crossing crossing from from the the mainland
might might be be down down at at the the shore but but the the attacking attacking party party had had to to take take a a chance chance
of of that the the short short passage passage was was accomplished accomplished before before the the next next
flash

the the inner inner side side of of the the little little island the the trees trees and and bushes bushes down down to to
the the water absolute absolute silence the the canoe canoe along close close in
bright bright flash flash of of lightning quickly quickly by by a a peal peal of of thunder
caused caused to to hold hold his his blade blade motionless boat boat was was well well by by
the the trees however and and there there was was no no sign sign that that it it had had been been observed

flash flash of of lightning lightning had had revealed revealed something something to to ahead ahead was was a a
little little curve curve in in the the margin margin of of the the island and and beyond beyond it a a short blunt blunt
projection a a bit bit of of beach beach with with growing growing well well down down upon upon it the the
beach beach were were two two reach reach the the spot however it it would would be be necessary necessary
to to pass pass an an open open gap a a sort sort of of lane lane leading leading up up from from the the shore shore to to the the
place place where where the the fire fire burned the the gap gap the the firelight firelight out out upon upon
the the water would would never never do do to to try try to to pass pass in in the the canoe

dipped dipped his his paddle paddle and and it it a a twist understood too too
saw saw the the firelight firelight on on the the water canoe canoe towards towards shore shore and and
down it it could could touch touch and and make make a a noise was was overside
stepping stepping quickly quickly but but carefully to to avoid avoid the the slightest slightest splash
in in the the boat allowed allowed his his end end to to swing swing in in far far
enough enough so so he he could could grasp grasp an an overhanging overhanging branch branch and and hold hold the the craft craft steady

came came the the most most difficult difficult part part of of the the undertaking to to creep creep in in the the
darkness darkness through through the the dense dense growth which which came came clear clear to to the the water water line
around around to to the the beach beach where where the the canoe canoe lay as as leader intended intended to to go go
first but but he he did did not not get get the the chance he he what what the the younger younger
boy boy was was about had had past past him him and and taken taken the the lead was was
well well he he did did so so for for slender slender and and agile was was an an adept adept at at
his his way way snakelike and and he he to to have have a a sixth sixth sense sense in in the the darkness darkness
that that did did not not possess was was constrained constrained to to let let his his younger younger
brother brother pick pick the the route had had all all he he could could do do to to follow follow without without rustling rustling
or or crackling crackling the the thick thick growth was was necessarily necessarily very very slow only only a a
few few feet feet or or even even inches inches at at a a time there there came came a a lightning lightning flash
both both lay lay flat were were less less revealing revealing in in the the dense dense growth and and
the the trees trees stood stood thick thick between between the the two two and and the the fire

had had the the edge edge of of the the gap gap through through which which the the
firelight firelight could could see see the the fire fire itself a a big roaring roaring pile and and
the the moving moving around around it sound sound of of speaking speaking and and
came came to to his his ears back back with with one one foot he he a a
little little warning warning kick then then for for some some way way to to cross cross the the open open space

of of like like most most of of the the off off the the northwest northwest shore shore
of of the the lake of of a a low rock rock ridge ridge descending descending
gradually gradually to to the the water water on on one one side side and and more more abruptly abruptly on on the the other
lane lane was was a a natural natural opening opening down down a a steep steep slope slope from from the the ridge ridge top top to to the the
water at at the the base base of of the the open open rock rock lane at at the the very very edge edge of of the the
water a a row row of of low low so so low low that that they they did did not not shut shut off off the the
light light of of the the fire but but cast cast only only a a narrow narrow line line of of shadow one one way way to to
cross cross that that gap gap without without being being seen seen was was to to crawl crawl along along in in the the shadow shadow of of
those those bushes water water might might be be shallow shallow there there or or it it might might be be deep
flat put put one one hand hand into into the the shadowed shadowed water fingers fingers touched touched
bottom felt felt around around a a little then then forward water water proved proved
to to be be only only a a few few inches inches deep he he along along the the rock rock
bottom bottom in in the the narrow narrow band band of of shadow had had the the shelter shelter
of of the the woods woods beyond taking taking extreme extreme care care to to slip slip along along
like like an an eel without without a a splash

were were now now but but a a short short distance distance from from the the thick thick
growing growing the the pebbles pebbles shut shut off off the the firelight chief chief
peril peril was was that that might might be be the the boats and and ears ears
strained strained for for the the slightest slightest sign sign of of danger the the two two forward forward on on
hands hands and and knees the the first first canoe canoe without without alarm alarm and and on on
to to the the second hidden hidden from from the the around around the the fire the the
the the canoe canoe and and turned turned it it bottom bottom side side up his his knife knife from from
the the sheath sheath and and carefully without without a a sound sound of of cut cut a a great great hole hole in in
the the bark a a section section between between the the the the two two carried carried the the
boat boat out out a a few few feet feet and and it it upon upon the the water to to fill fill
immediately the the water water entering entering the the big big hole hole with with only only a a slight slight
noise that that sound sound alarmed alarmed the the beat beat a a hasty hasty retreat retreat and and
lay lay close close under under the the around around the the fire however were were
too too engrossed engrossed in in their their own own affairs affairs to to heed heed the the sound if if indeed indeed it it
carried carried that that far

man man with with a a full deep deep voice voice was was speaking speaking at at length his his reaching reaching
the the where where they they lay lay hidden now now and and then then his his broke broke in in
with with little little and and of of approval approval or or assent crash crash of of
thunder following following close close upon upon a a bright bright flash drowned drowned his his voice the the
rumbling rumbling he he was was no no longer longer speaking else else was was happening happening
now and and accompanied accompanied by by the the beating beating together together of of wood wood
and and metal metal and and the the click click of of in in rude rude rhythm came came to to the the
ears

are are thought thought fools fools to to make make such such an an exhibition exhibition
here here where where a a boat boat may may pass pass at at any any moment is is certainly certainly insane insane or or
very very sure sure he he is is invincible is is time time we we finished finished our our

from from his his side and and down down to to the the remaining remaining canoe
supposing supposing his his younger younger brother brother had had gone gone that that way was was not not there
several several minutes listening listening to to the the and and which
low low voiced voiced at at first were were growing growing louder louder and and as as the the warmed warmed
to to their their work one one of of them them uttered uttered a a yell which which was was by by
quite quite a a different different sound an an bellow bellow of of rage rage or or pain was was
both both alarmed alarmed and and curious was was going going on on up up there and and what what had had become become
of of

elder elder brother brother back back across across the the pebbles pushed pushed his his way way
cautiously cautiously among among the the and and up up a a short steep steep slope slope topped topped
by by more more bushes bushes and and trees through through which which the the firelight firelight
noises noises of of the the dance broken broken by by louder louder and and angry angry bellows continued
low low in in the the shadow through through at at the the scene scene
he he had had ever ever upon

the the open open space space a a big big fire fire blazed casting casting its its glare glare
over over the the picture the the fire fire and and the the boy the the dancing dancing of of
the the passed passed back back and and forth crouching gesticulating to to
the the rhythm rhythm of of their their hoarse hoarse and and the the of of their their weapons weapons and and

down down spine spine as as his his eyes eyes rested rested upon upon that that huge towering towering form form and and
the the set cruel cruel face it it was was neither neither the the war war dance dance nor nor that that
held held his his surprised surprised gaze gaze longest

little little to to one one side side of of the the fire the the tall tall birch birch rose rose straight straight and and high high
above above its its fellows its its white white stem stem was was tied not not a a human human victim victim this this
time but but the the dark dark form form of of an an animal a a moose the the beast beast its its
head head about about in in frenzy could could see see that that its its still still covered covered with with

rage rage and and pain madly madly about swaying swaying the the birch birch almost almost to to
breaking bonds bonds were were strong strong and and the the tree tree failed failed to to snap yet yet the the boy boy
how how long long it it would would be be before before something something and and freed freed the the
frenzied frenzied beast thought thought the the young young moose moose did did not not realize realize his his own own
strength but but when when he he should should find find it it out did did not not want want to to be be in in the the
way

was was just just about about to to retreat retreat to to the the beach when when the the dancing dancing
suddenly suddenly stopped of of rain rain were were beginning beginning to to fall but but the the shower shower
was was not not the the reason reason for for the the cessation cessation of of the the dancing had had raised raised
his his arm arm in in an an impressive impressive gesture lowered lowered their their weapons weapons and and
and and back back to to the the other other side side of of the the fire
forward forward and and the the moose
thunder thunder there there came came a a sharp sharp dash dash of of rain the the fire fire hissing hissing and and
like like a a live live thing thing as as the the drops drops struck struck it did did not not
intend intend to to be be deprived deprived of of his his cruel cruel sport sport by by a a mere mere thunder thunder shower
held held in in his his right right hand hand a a long long pole pole with with a a knife knife to to the the end
just just out out of of reach reach of of the the and and
he he directly directly at at its its throat

came came a a dazzling dazzling flash a a flare flare of of light a a stunning stunning crash crash that that
to to shatter shatter as as the the flash flash blinded blinded his his eyes
they they received received a a momentary momentary impression impression of of a a great great black black object object hurtling hurtling at at
and and over over the the giant giant as as he he backward backward into into the the fire next next
instant instant a a huge huge bulk bulk through through the the bushes bushes almost almost on on top top of of the the boy
tremendous tremendous splash splash








rain rain came came down down in in torrents and and and and a a
roaring roaring in in his his head his his whole whole body body shaking shaking convulsively lay lay on on his his face face
among among the the bushes hand hand seized seized his his shoulder shoulder and and he he came came to to
himself up up and and for for the the knife knife he he had had borrowed borrowed from from
then then it it was was his his who who was was speaking

whispered me me

rain rain was was lessening the the thunder thunder were were not not so so deafening the the
beach beach below below came came the the sound sound of of bitterness that that

and and had had discovered discovered that that the the other other was was missing

the the other had had always always worn worn it it on on a a cord cord around around her her neck but but when when she she
was was a a squaw squaw had had taken taken it it from from her first first
thought thought that that the the thing thing she she had had possessed possessed had had been been one one of of the the little little
sometimes sometimes given given by by a a priest priest to to a a child but but she she had had
that that one one side side of of her her medal medal had had been been like like the the coin he he

taken taken the the coin coin from from the the neck neck of of an an captive captive years years before the the
couple couple who who had had brought brought the the girl girl up up had had come come by by her was was
unable unable to to find find out but but he he had had no no doubt doubt that that she she was was really really the the daughter daughter
of of resolved resolved to to send send the the proof proof of of his his parentage parentage to to
by by his his elder elder son if if had had really really come come to to the the and and had had
there was was not not there the the elder elder would would go go to to the the
city city himself was was plain plain that that he he had had not not received received either either of of the the letters letters

first first instance to to use use his his own own language in one one of of good good trusty trusty
of of and and two folio but but
later later on on he he made made the the sad sad discovery discovery that that this this good trusty trusty
had had uplifted uplifted what what he he called called his his true and and particular particular account from from the the
book book of of without without any any acknowledgment ways ways that that are are dark the the
old old compiler compiler of of travels travels was was not not easily easily but but why why should should
have have gone gone out out of of his his way way to to call call an an
bookmaker about about whom whom he he nothing good and and trusty
was was never never either either the the one one or or the the other and and a a pauper

journey journey to to in in was was no no joke who who was was
accompanied accompanied by by his his wife wife and and eldest eldest son although although ready ready to to start start from from
by by the the end end of of was was doomed doomed to to spend spend both both the the of of
and and in in the the gloomy gloomy town town of of which which they they had had
by by water on on the the of of of of this this time time
was was spent spent in in quarrelling quarrelling as as to to who who was was to to supply supply the the that that were were
required required to to convey convey the the ambassador ambassador and and all all his his impedimenta along along the the
now now icebound roads roads to to was was one one of of many many duties duties to to
remonstrate remonstrate with with the the authorities authorities for for their their cruel cruel and and disrespectful disrespectful
indifference he he did did so so with with great great freedom but but with with no no effect and and at at
last last the the ambassador ambassador was was obliged obliged to to hire hire two two hundred hundred at at his his own own
he he sent sent on on ahead following following with with one one hundred hundred and and forty forty on on
the the of of was was an an intensely intensely cold cold journey and and the the
accommodation accommodation at at night with with one one happy happy exception proved proved quite quite infamous
the the of of and and his his found found themselves themselves
five five from from of of was was fixed fixed for for their their entry entry
into into the the city city in in all all their their finery were were ready ready on on the the morning morning of of
that that day the the arrival arrival of of the the escort but but it it never never came

expected expected to to eat eat in in his his and and it it was was
not not till till half an an hour hour before before night that that the the belated belated
full full of of ambassador ambassador was was hungry cold and and furious
nor nor did did his his anger anger abate abate when when told told he he was was not not to to be be allowed allowed to to enter enter
that that night as as the the and and his his were were very very anxious anxious to to
enjoy enjoy the the spectacle return return of of the the cooks cooks from from and and the the
preparation preparation of of dinner though though a a mitigation was was no no cure cure for for wounded wounded
pride and and calling calling to to his his side and and with with his his
assistance a a letter letter in in to to the the
bitterly bitterly of of their their illtreatment inter sordes sordes et et
sine sine aut aut potu and and going going so so far far as as to to assert assert that that had had
anything anything of of the the kind kind in in to to a a foreign foreign ambassador the the
of of would would never never have have rested rested until until the the had had been been
for for with with the the blood blood of of the the some some forty forty years years
afterwards the the asked asked to to chop chop off off the the heads heads of of
the the rude rude men men who who had had arrested arrested his his ambassador ambassador for for debt he he had perhaps
letter letter before before him

the the of of and and his his suite suite made made their their public public
entry entry into into but but so so long long a a time time was was occupied occupied over over the the few few
they they had had to to travel that that it it was was dusk dusk before before the the was was

formal formal reception reception of of the the ambassador ambassador was was on on the the of of

more more than than one by by the the dozen
and and all all easy easy to to identify identify on on the the map and and very very
hard hard to to read read out out in in a a loud loud voice voice by by the the end end
of of them them came came the the homely homely title title of of the the and and his his offices his
in in the the of of and and

letters letters read read and and delivered the the and and his his rose rose in in their their
places places simultaneously and and their their tissue tissue made made so so strange loud and and
unexpected unexpected a a noise noise as as to to provoke provoke the the ever ever too too easily easily moved moved risibility risibility
of of the the and and the the rest rest of of them them had had
from from the the after after the the health health of of the the king but but the the
distance distance between between his his and and being being too too great great
for for the the question question to to carry it it had had to to be be repeated repeated by by those those who who were were
nearer nearer the the ambassador who who gravely gravely that that when when he he last last saw saw his his
master namely namely on on the the of of then then last last past he he was was perfectly perfectly
well the the same same question question as as to to the the health health of of the desolate desolate widow widow of of
the the the the same same cautious cautious answer then then
read read a a very very long long speech speech in in which which his his interpreter interpreter turned turned into into
same same oration oration was was into into by by and and
trouble trouble arose for for the the were were
bent bent on on taking taking and and giving giving had had styled styled the the
when when he he ought so so it it was was alleged to to have have called called him him
was was not not a a son an an old old scholar scholar of of
and and assistant assistant as as for for nothing
prepared prepared a a reply reply which as as it it does does not not lack lack has has a a distinct distinct
literary literary and and is is all all that that came came of of the the embassy may may here here be be given given
at at length

reply he that that sent sent no no such such paper paper into into the the
but but upon upon the the desire desire of of his his
delivered delivered it it to to him not not
being being a a paper paper of of nor nor written written in in the the wherein wherein
treat nor nor put put into into the the hands hands of of the the near near and and of of
his his majesty nor nor subscribed subscribed by by my my self nor nor into into
by by my my but but only only as as a a piece piece of of curiosity which which is is
now now restored restored me and and am am possessed possessed of of it so so that that herein herein his his
near near and and are are doubtless doubtless ill ill
grounded again again say say concerning concerning the the value value of of the the words words
and and compared compared together seeing seeing we we must must
here here from from affaires affaires of of fall fall into into
concerning concerning the the tongue that that the the word word
nothing nothing but but still still and and calm and therefore though though of of late late times times
adopted adopted into into the the of of great great by by reason reason of of that that
tranquility tranquility which which properly properly in in the the countenance countenance of of
great great and and that that venerable venerable stillness stillness of of all all the the
that that surround surround them of of which which have have seen seen an an excellent excellent example example when when
was was in in the the presence presence of of his his majesty yet yet is is more more properly properly
used used concerning concerning the the calmness calmness of of the the weather or or season that that even even
the the night night is is elegantly elegantly called called by by the the best best in in
i l nox and and upon upon again again
what what have have writ writ in in this this paper that that have have out out of of the the
of of that that expression expression my my self self near near the the beginning beginning said
that that most most serene serene night c on on the the contrary contrary in in
its its proper proper derivation derivation and and signification signification that that which which is is all all
resplendent lightsome and and glorious as as well well without without as as within and and
that that not not with with a a secondary secondary but but with with a a primitive primitive and and original original light
if if the the be as as he he is the the first first fountain fountain of of light and and
in in their their expressions expressions as is is well well known are are higher higher by by much much than than those those
that that write write in in what what else else is is it it when when in in the the of of the the
of of speaking speaking with with
quaterque quaterque caput and and the the as as
when when they they would would say say the the highest highest thing thing that that can can be be
upon upon any any subject word word it it thus dicere dicere
possum that that hereby hereby may may appear appear to to his his near near
and and what what diminution diminution there there is is to to his his
which be be it it from from my my thoughts if if appropriate appropriate
to to my my and and to to than than which which
nihil potest potest because because this this was was in in the the time time of of
the the purity purity of of the the tongue when when the the word word was was never never
used used in in the the of of any any or or shall shall go go on on to to
with with the the utmost utmost candor forasmuch forasmuch as as in in this this the the nicety nicety of of
that that most most eloquent eloquent language language is is not not so so perfectly perfectly understood which which
occasion occasion to to these these confess confess therefore therefore that that indeed indeed in in
the the declination declination of of the the tongue and and when when there there scarce scarce could could be be
found found out out words words enough enough to to supply supply the the modern modern ambition ambition of of
as as several several other other words words hath hath grown grown in in fashion fashion for for a a
compellation compellation of of lesser lesser as as well well as as greater greater and and yet yet
both both the the one one and and the the other there there is is
even even as as the the
word word or or a a a a a a or or an an
to to it it the the respective respective quality and and so so the the word word
suppose suppose it it were were by by modern modern use use which deny
depressed depressed from from the the undoubted undoubted superiority superiority that that it it had had of of in in
the the antiquity yet yet being being added added in in the the transcendent transcendent degree degree to to
the the word word the the highest highest denomination denomination that that a a is is capable capable
of it it of of the the same same value that that to to interpret interpret
unto unto diminution diminution is is to to find find a a positive positive in in a a
superlative and and in in the the most most orient orient light light to to seek seek for for darkness

gladly gladly be be satisfied satisfied by by them whether whether ever ever any any
writ writ formerly formerly hither hither in in and and whether whether then then

answer answer to to the the objection objection that that the the civil civil magistrate magistrate might might establish establish a a
worship worship in in its its own own nature nature sinful sinful and and sensual it it is is not not
in in the the least least likely and and the the risk risk must must be be run is is to to find find
out out the the best best way way of of settling settling the the world world that that the the state state of of things things admit admit
indeed indeed mankind mankind were were infallible this this controversy controversy were were at at an an end
but but seeing seeing that that all all men men are are liable liable to to and and and and seeing seeing
that that there there is is an an absolute absolute necessity necessity of of a a supreme supreme power power in in all all public public
affairs our our question question say is is is the the most most prudent prudent and and expedient expedient
way way of of settling settling them not not that that possibly possibly might might be but but that that really really is
this this as have have already already sufficiently sufficiently proved is is to to devolve devolve their their
management management on on the the supreme supreme civil civil power power which though though it it may may be be imperfect imperfect
and and liable liable to to and and yet yet tis the the least least so and and is is a a much much
better better way way to to attain attain public public peace peace and and tranquillity tranquillity than than if if they they were were
left left to to the the ignorance ignorance and and folly folly of of every every private private man

now now feel feel that that at at least least have have done done full full justice but but as as so so far far
have have hardly hardly given given an an example example of of his his familiar familiar style must must find find room room
for for two two or or three three final final thing thing hated hated most most in in the the
world world was was a a against against the the weakness weakness which which
is is content content with with passing passing penal penal laws but but does does not not see see them them carried carried out out
for for fear fear of of these these trumpery trumpery tender tender mens
minds minds or or are are weak silly silly and and ignorant ignorant things acted acted by by fond fond
and and absurd absurd and and imposed imposed upon upon by by their their and and their their
passions if if the the obligation obligation of of laws laws must must yield yield to to that that
of of a a tender tender conscience how how impregnably impregnably is is every every man man that that has has a a mind mind to to
disobey disobey armed armed against against all all the the of of his his authority authority
shall shall be be able able to to govern govern him him farther farther than than he he himself himself pleases and and if if he he
dislike dislike the the law law he he is is sufficiently sufficiently excused excused weak weak conscience conscience is is
the the product product of of a a weak weak understanding and and he he is is a a very very man man that that
can can find find the the difference difference between between a a tender tender head head and and a a tender tender conscience conscience
is is a a glorious glorious thing thing to to suffer suffer for for a a tender tender conscience and and
therefore therefore it it is is easy easy and and natural natural for for some some people people to to affect affect some some little little
against against the the of of authority thereby thereby to to make make themselves themselves
obnoxious obnoxious to to some some little little penalties and and then then what what godly godly men men are are they they
that that are are so so ready ready to to be be punished punished for for a a good good conscience
voice voice of of the the law law cannot cannot but but drown drown the the uncertain uncertain of of a a
tender tender conscience all all its its are are hushed hushed and and silenced silenced by by the the
of of authority not not whimper whimper when when that that and and the the
nod nod of of a a prince prince it it into into silence silence and and submission if if they they dare dare to to
murmur and and their their proud proud will will swell swell against against the the of of their their
then then there there is is no no remedy remedy but but the the rod rod and and correction must must

to to of of

told told you you at at our our last last meeting the the winter winter
was was the the time time for for business and and truly truly thought thought so till till my my
assured assured me me the the spring spring was was the the best best season season for for
and and hope hope therefore therefore that that will will not not prove prove so so
unnatural unnatural a a month as as not not to to afford afford some some kind kind showers showers on on my my parched parched
exchequer which which for for want want of of them of of you perhaps will will
think think it it dangerous dangerous to to make make me me too too rich but but do do not not fear fear it for for
promise promise you you faithfully whatever whatever you you give give me me will will always always want and and
although although in in other other things things my my word word may may be be thought thought a a slender slender authority
yet yet in in that you you may may rely rely on on me will will never never break break it

can can bear bear my my straits straits with with patience but but my my
does does protest protest to to me that that the the revenue as as it it now now
stands will will not not serve serve him him and and me me too of of us us must must pinch pinch for for it
if if you you do do not not help help me must must speak speak freely freely to to you am am under under bad bad
circumstances for for besides besides my my in in service my my
lye lye heavy heavy upon upon me have have a a passable passable good good estate
confess but have have a a great great charge charge upon upon t my my
can can tell that that all all the the money money designed designed for for next next
guards guards must of of necessity be be to to the the next next years
and and shall shall we we do do for for then hint hint
this this only only to to you it it being being your your busyness not not mine know by by
experience can can live live without without lived lived ten ten years years abroad abroad
without and and never never had had my my health health better better in in my my life but but how how you you will will
be be without leave leave to to to to judge and and therefore therefore hint hint this this
only only by by the the bye do do not not insist insist upon upon it another another thing thing
must must press press more more earnestly and and that that is is seems seems a a good good part part of of
my my revenue revenue will will expire expire in in two two or or three three years except except you you will will be be
pleased pleased to to continue continue it have have to to say say for for t pray why why did did you you give give
me me so so much much as as you you have have done unless unless you you resolve resolve to to give give on on as as fast fast as as
call call for for it nation nation you you already already for for giving giving so so much and and
hate hate you you too if if you you do do not not give give me me more that that if if you you stick stick
not not to to me you you must must not not have have a a friend friend in in the the other other hand
if if you you will will give give me me the the revenue revenue desire shall shall be be able able to to do do those those
things things for for your your religion religion and and liberty that that have have had had long long in in my my
thoughts but but cannot cannot effect effect them them without without a a little little more more money money to to carry carry
me me through look look to to t and and take take notice notice that that if if you you do do not not
make make me me rich rich enough enough to to undo undo you it it shall shall lie lie at at your your doors my my
part part wash wash my my hands hands on on t that that may may gain gain your your good good opinion
the the best best way way is is to to acquaint acquaint you you what what have have done done to to deserve deserve it out out
of of my my royal royal care care for for your your religion religion and and your your property the the first
my my proclamation proclamation is is a a true true picture picture of of my my mind that that cannot as as in in a a
glass see see my my zeal zeal for for the the of of does does not not deserve deserve any any
farther farther satisfaction for for declare declare him him abominable and and not not
good may perhaps be be startled and and cry how how comes comes this this sudden sudden
change which which answer am am a a and and thats sufficient
think to to convince convince men men farther that that mean mean what what say there there are are
these these arguments

was was no no shaking shaking off off religion religion from from the the debates debates of of those those days new new
suddenly suddenly in in the the of of where where it it rise rise
to to one one of of the the greatest greatest debates debates that that assembly assembly has has ever ever witnessed
lasting lasting seventeen seventeen days bishops bishops were were baited baited by by the the peers peers with with great great
spirit and and the the report report of of the the proceedings proceedings may may still still be be read read with with gusto

in in his his of of thus thus what what

these these things things were were upon upon the the anvil the the of of was was
come come for for the the sitting but but that that was was put put off off till till the the
of of in in the the meantime which which fell fell out out most most opportune opportune for for
the the these these were were and and something something further further
to to be be contrived that that was was yet yet wanting the the accordingly accordingly
meeting and and the the of of as as well well as as that that of of the the
being being in in deliberation deliberation of of several several wholesome wholesome bills such such as as the the present present
state state of of the the nation nation required the the great great design design came came out out in in a a bill bill
unexpectedly unexpectedly offered offered one one morning morning in in the the of of whereby whereby all all
such such as as any any beneficial beneficial office or or ecclesiastical
civil or or military to to which which was was added added privy privy justices justices of of
the the peace and and members members of of were were under under a a penalty penalty to to take take
the the oath and and make make the the declaration and and abhorrence

do do declare that that it it is is not not lawful lawful upon upon any any
whatsoever whatsoever to to take take up up arms arms against against the the and and that that do do
abhor abhor that that position position of of taking taking arms arms by by his his authority authority
against against his his person or or against against those those that that are are commissioned commissioned by by
him him in in pursuance pursuance of of such such commission do do swear that that
will will not not at at any any time time the the alteration alteration of of the the government government
either either in in or or help help me me

same same oath oath had had been been brought brought into into the the of of in in the the
plague plague year year at at to to have have been been imposed imposed upon upon the the nation but but
there by by the the assistance assistance of of those those very very same same persons persons that that now now
introduce introduce it twas thrown thrown out for for fear fear of of a a general general infection infection of of
the the vitals vitals of of this this kingdom and and though though it it passed passed then then in in a a particular particular
bill known known by by the the name name of of the the because because it it only only
concerned concerned the the nonconformist yet yet even even in in that it it was was
thoroughly thoroughly opposed opposed by by the the late late of of whose whose judgement judgement
might might well well have have been been for for the the standard standard of of prudence prudence and and


the the proposed proposed oath oath could could ever ever in in more more
compendious compendious or or binding binding terms terms have have drawn drawn a a of of the the whole whole
birthright birthright of of

was was no no mere mere legal legal quibbling

things things are are no no or or remote remote though in in
making making of of laws and and which which must must come come afterwards afterwards under under construction construction of of
judges bene bene all all are are to to be be put put and and imagined
but but there there being being an an act act in in for for men men to to march march into into
upon upon call and and so so great great a a body body of of soldiery soldiery in in
within within summons besides besides what what may may be be obliged obliged by by treaty treaty to to
furnish and and it it being being so so fresh fresh in in memory what what sort sort of of persons persons had had
lately lately been been in in commission commission among among us to to which which add add the the many many books books then then
printed printed by by license writ some some by by men men of of the the black one one of of the the green green
cloth wherein wherein the the absoluteness absoluteness of of the the monarchy monarchy is is against against
all all law law asserted

these these put put together together were were sufficient sufficient to to make make any any
honest honest and and well well advised advised man man to to conceive conceive indeed that that upon upon the the passing passing
of of this this oath oath and and declaration the the whole whole sum sum of of affairs affairs depended

therefore therefore to to the the greatest greatest contest that that has has perhaps perhaps ever ever
been been in in wherein wherein those those that that were were against against this this oath
being being assured assured of of their their own own loyalty loyalty and and merit stood stood up up now now for for the the
liberties liberties with with the the same same genius virtue and and courage that that
their their noble noble ancestors ancestors had had formerly formerly defended defended the the great great of of
but but with with so so much much greater greater commendation in in that that they they had had here here
a a field field and and a a more more civil civil way way of of decision they they it it out out
under under all all the the they they were were by by
numbers the the noise noise of of the the like like the the wind was was against against them and and
if if not not the the sun the the fireside fireside was was always always in in their their faces nor nor being being so so
few could could they as as their their withdraw withdraw to to refresh refresh themselves themselves
in in a a whole whole days yet yet never never was was there there a a
demonstration demonstration how how dull dull a a thing thing is is humane humane eloquence and and greatness greatness
how how little when when the the bright bright truth truth all all things things in in their their
proper proper and and dimensions and and shining its its beams beams
all all their their fallacies might might be be injurious where where all all of of them them did did so so
excellently excellently well to to attribute attribute more more to to any any one one of of those those than than
another unless unless because because the the of of and and the the of of
have have been been the the more more for for this this brave brave action it it
be be requisite requisite by by a a double double proportion proportion of of praise praise to to set set them them two two on on
equal equal terms terms with with the the rest rest of of their their in in
particular particular relation relation in in this this debate which which many many days with with
great great eagerness eagerness on on both both sides and and the the reasons reasons but but on on one was was in in the the
next next burnt burnt by by order order of of the the but but the the sparks sparks of of it it will will

night night without without rising rising and the the all all the the while while but but of of our our addresses addresses
present upon upon their their of of in in both both and and are are not not yet yet come come to to
the the question question of of it

prolonged prolonged discussion discussion the the was was sent sent to to the the where where
doubtless doubtless it it must must have have passed had had not not a a furious furious privilege privilege quarrel quarrel over over
case case made made prorogation prorogation in in almost almost a a necessity
met met again and and at at once once resolved resolved itself itself into into a a

king king made made almost almost an an end end of of the the by by a a prorogation prorogation which which
from from until until period period of of fifteen fifteen months

the the of of the the of of the the
argument argument much much used used during during the the long long recess that that a a prorogation prorogation
beyond beyond twelve twelve months months was was in in construction construction of of law law a a dissolution

the the expression expression of of this this opinion opinion and and the the refusal refusal to to recant recant it it the the

king king being being greatly greatly angered angered by by the the dukes request request that that his his cook cook might might be be
allowed allowed to to wait wait on on him this this incident incident a a
prorogation prorogation without without precedent precedent was was to to be be warranted warranted by by an an imprisonment imprisonment
without without example sad sad instance the the dignity dignity of of and and
especially especially of of the the of of did did at at present present much much suffer suffer and and may may
probably probably more more for for the the future for nothing nothing but but can can destroy destroy
a a shall shall once once be be felon felon of of itself itself and and stop stop its its own own
breath taking taking away away that that liberty liberty of of speech speech which which the the verbally and and
of of course them them as now now they they had had done done in in both both to to what what
purpose purpose is is it it coming coming

character character of of this this of of did did not not improve improve with with age

in in the the of of

matters matters of of money money they they seem seem at at first first difficult but but having having been been
with with in in private they they are are set set right and and begin begin to to
understand understand it it better better themselves and and to to convert convert their their brethren for for
they they are are all all of of them them to to be be bought bought and and sold only only their their number number makes makes
them them and and each each of of them them doth doth so so overvalue overvalue himself that that
sometimes sometimes they they or or let let slip slip their their own own market

is is not not to to be be imagined how how small small things in in this this case even even
members members of of great great will will stoop stoop at and and most most of of them them will will do do as as
much much for for hopes hopes as as others others for for fruition but but if if their their patience patience be be tired tired
out they they grow grow at at last last mutinous and and revolt revolt to to the the country till till some some
better better occasion occasion offer

these these are are some some men men of of the the best best understanding understanding were were they they of of
equal equal integrity who who affect affect to to all all business to to be be able able to to
quash quash any any good good motion motion by by parliamentary parliamentary skill unless unless themselves themselves be be
the the authors and and to to be be the the leading leading men men of of the the and and for for their their
natural natural lives lives to to continue continue so these these are are men men that that have have been been once once
most most of of them and and discovered and and at at so so that that
till till some some turn turn of of shall shall let let them them in in their their place
in in the the mean mean time time they they look look sullen make make big big and and contrive contrive
specious specious bills bills for for the the subject yet yet only only wait wait the the opportunity opportunity to to be be
the the instruments instruments of of the the same same which which they they oppose oppose in in others

is is a a third third part part still still remaining but but as as contrary contrary in in themselves themselves
as as light light and and darkness those those are are either either the the worst or or the the best best of of
men the the first first are are most most profligate profligate persons they they have have neither neither
nor nor good good manners yet yet are are therefore therefore picked picked out out
as as the the necessary necessary men and and whose whose will will go go furthest the the
of of their their are are whatever whatever they they amount amount to tables tables are are
kept kept for for them them at at and and through through that that they they may may be be
ready ready at at hand within within call call of of a a question all all of of them them are are received received
into into pension and and know know their their payday which which they they never never fail fail of
insomuch insomuch that that a a great great officer officer was was pleased pleased to to say they they came came
about about him him like like so so many many for for cheese cheese at at the the end end of of every every
they they be be not not in in they they must must be be in in prison and and
as as they they are are protected protected themselves by by privilege so so they they sell sell their their
to to others to to the the obstruction obstruction so so many many years years together together of of
the the law law of of the the land and and the the justice for for these these it it is that that
the the long long and and frequent frequent are are calculated but but all all whether whether
the the court or or the the of of the the country country party or or those those that that
profane profane the the title title of of old old do do equally though though upon upon differing differing
reasons like like death death apprehend apprehend a a dissolution notwithstanding notwithstanding
these there there is is an an handful handful of of salt a a sparkle sparkle of of soul that that hath hath
hitherto hitherto preserved preserved this this gross gross body body from from putrefaction some some gentlemen gentlemen
that that are are constant invariable indeed indeed such such as as are are above above
hopes or or fears or or dissimulation that that can can neither neither flatter nor nor
betray betray their their king king or or country but but being being conscious conscious of of their their own own
loyalty loyalty and and integrity proceed proceed throw throw good good and and bad bad report to to acquit acquit
themselves themselves in in their their duty duty to to their their prince and and their their nation
although although so so small small a a scantling scantling in in number that that men men can can scarce scarce reckon reckon
of of them them more more than than a a quorum insomuch insomuch that that it it is is less less difficult difficult to to
conceive conceive how how fire fire was was first first brought brought to to light light in in the the world world than than how how
any any good good thing thing could could ever ever be be produced produced out out of of an an of of so so
constituted unless unless as as that that is is imagined imagined to to have have come come from from the the rushing rushing
of of trees or or battering battering of of rocks rocks together by by accident so so these by by
their their clashing clashing with with one one another have have struck struck out out an an useful useful effect effect
from from so so unlikely unlikely causes whatsoever whatsoever casual casual good good hath hath been been wrought wrought

disappointed disappointed members to to the the little but but solid and and unbiassed unbiassed party
the the more more frequent frequent ill ill effects and and consequences consequences of of so so unequal unequal a a

and and it it is is as as wellknown among among them to to what what each each of of them them
retain as as when when formerly formerly they they coats coats and and this this long long
haunting haunting so so together they they are are grown grown too too so so familiar familiar among among
themselves that that all all reverence reverence of of their their own own is is lost that that
they they live live together together not not like like men but but like like so so many many good good
fellows fellows met met together together in in a a house house to to make make merry which which is is
yet yet worse by by being being so so thoroughly thoroughly acquainted they they understand understand their their
number number and and party so so that that the the use use of of so so a a counsel counsel is is

saw saw a a box box on on the the ear ear given and and it it was was his his duty duty to to inform inform the the house house
of of it this this debate debate

passed passed was was through through great great acquaintance acquaintance and and
familiarity familiarity betwixt betwixt us neither neither him him an an affront nor nor intended intended
him him any the the cast cast a a severe severe reflection reflection upon upon him him yesterday
when when he he was was out out of of the the house and and he he hopes hopes that as as the the keeps keeps
us us in in order he he will will keep keep himself himself in in order order for for the the future

the the said said yesterday yesterday was was in in
vindication these these two two gentlemen gentlemen are are friends friends already he he would would not not
make make them them friends and and would would let let the the matter matter go go no no further

is is sorry sorry a a thing thing of of this this nature nature has has
and and no no more more sense sense of of it in in the the and and a a stroke stroke struck

had had some some kind kind of of a a stumble and and mine mine
was was only only a a thrust and and the the thing thing was was accidental

persons persons have have declared declared the the thing thing to to be be
accidental but but if if done done in in jest not not fit fit to to be be done done here
it it an an accident and and hopes hopes the the house house thinks thinks so so too

does does appear that that the the action action for for that that
time time was was in in some some heat cannot cannot excuse excuse who who made made a a very very
severe severe reflection reflection on on the the and and since since it it is is so so
whether whether you you have have done done your your duty he he would would have have withdraw that that
you you may may consider consider of of it

has has given given you you trouble and and instead instead of of
himself upon upon the the a a strange strange confidence if if
not not an an impudence

so so great great a a respect respect to to the the privilege order and and
decency of of the the house that that he he is is content content to to be be a a sacrifice sacrifice for for it
to to the the casualty casualty that that he he saw saw a a seat seat empty and and going going to to
sit sit in in it his his friend friend put put him him by in in a a jocular jocular manner and and what what he he
did did was was of of the the same same nature much much familiarity familiarity has has ever ever been been between between
them that that there there was was no no heat heat in in the the thing is is sorry sorry he he an an
to to the the house seldom seldom speaks speaks to to the the house and and if if he he commit commit
an an error in in the the manner manner of of his his speech being being not not so so well well tuned he he
hopes hopes it it is is not not an an out out or or in in the the house he he has has a a
respect respect to to the the he he has has been been informed informed that that the the
something something he he had had said with with reflection did did not not think think fit fit
to to complain complain of of to to that that is is not not
reflective to to comport comport himself himself with with all all respect respect to to the the
house passage passage with with was was a a perfect perfect casualty and and if if you you
think think fit he he will will withdraw and and sacrifice sacrifice himself himself to to the the censure censure of of
the the house

blow blow given given was was with with his his hat the the
cast cast his his eye eye upon upon both both of of them and and both both respected respected him
would would not not aggravate aggravate the the thing and and he he would would have have you you
leave leave the the thing thing as as it it is

saw saw the the whole whole action about about three three
or or four four times times with with his his hat and and then then a a box box on on the the ear

now now that that his his is is concerned that that
may may explain whether whether he he saw saw not not with with his his hat hat only only give give
the the stroke stroke at that that time at another another time it it
might might be

and and are are in in the the right
struck struck so so home that that his his fist as as well well as as his his hat hit hit him

hopes hopes the the house house will will not not have have say say he he
received received a a blow when when he he has has not thinks thinks what what has has been been said said by by
them them both both sufficient

hopes that that by by the the debate debate we we shall shall not not make make the the thing thing
greater greater than than it it is have have them them both both for for it

the the of of the the house house to to the the house
have have them them made made friends and and give give that that necessary necessary assurance assurance to to
the the house and and he for for his his part remains remains satisfied

our our long long sitting sitting together we we lose by by our our
familiarity familiarity and and acquaintance the the of of the the house has has seen seen
in in the the house and and people people very very orderly not not so so much much as as to to read read a a
letter or or set set up up a a foot could could scarce scarce know know anybody anybody in in the the house
but but him him that that spoke would would have have the the declare declare that that order order
ought ought to to be be kept but but as as to to that that gentleman gentleman to to rest rest
satisfied

general general impression impression left left upon upon the the mind mind is is that that of of a a
but but choleric choleric gentleman full full of of likes likes and and with with his his
tongue tongue in in the the lobby lobby than than with with set in in the the solitary solitary
politician politician with with a a biting biting pen must must not not complain complain if if they they have have

advice

the the queer queer little little old old man man was was happy happy to to think think that that he he had had been been able able

morning as as was was sitting sitting in in front front of of his his cave cave
himself he he heard heard some some one one crying

was was a a sort sort of of cry

could could not not imagine imagine who who it it could could be be that that was was in in trouble

around but but saw saw no no one

he he listened sound sound came came from from behind behind a a large large tree tree near near by
walked walked over over to to the the spot there there do do you you suppose

crying crying into into his his maple-leaf handkerchief handkerchief as as
though though his his very very heart heart would would break

is is the the matter asked asked

let me me tell tell you you
what what some some bad bad did did to to me

nuts nuts which which the the stole think think can can send send some some one one to to help help you you
gather gather more

are are still still some some nuts nuts on on the the ground and and we'll well help help you you to to find find
them

for for his his kind kind words he he
dried dried his his tears tears and and for for home

the the queer queer little little old old man man sat sat the the bushy bushy tail tail as as it it
down down the the crooked crooked path path and and out out of of sight

all all of of a a sudden sudden he he heard heard a a sharp sharp

even even looking looking up up who who it it was friend friend in in
need he he said said to to himself

he he called called to to the the woodpecker woodpecker that that was was doing doing the the wish wish
to to talk talk with with you he he said

down and and told told him him all all about about


we we will will help help him him gather gather a a fresh fresh store store of of nuts said said
we we will will help he he away

a a very very short short time time a a whole whole flock flock of of was was flying flying
toward toward home

troubles troubles were were over for for the the
filled filled his his winter winter storeroom storeroom full full of of the the nuts he he was was sure sure
of of having having plenty plenty to to eat eat all all winter winter for for himself himself and and his his family how how
thankful thankful he he was

that that is is not not all

the the were were through through filling filling the the storeroom storeroom
with with nuts did did they they stop

indeed woodpecker woodpecker who who was was older older than than the the others others up up on on the the
topmost topmost branch branch of of the the tree tree and and said

do do you you realize realize now now how how foolish foolish we we have have been been all all our our
lives

the the summer summer we we feed feed on on and and and and and and seeds

in in the the winter because because we we know know no no better some some of of us us go go
of of us us go go hungry and and some some of of us us die because because we we cannot cannot find find
enough enough to to eat

cannot cannot we too store store up up nuts nuts and and have have food food for for the the winter winter as as the the
do

very very thing the the other other

they they all all gathering gathering and and and and storing storing them them in in
the the bark bark of of the the trees

of of the the nuts nuts they they would would drop drop beneath beneath the the bark bark of of the the tree
some some they they would would drive drive with with their their strong strong bills bills into into cracks cracks and and holes holes
which which they they found found here here and and there

trees trees which which were were old old and and wormeaten were of of course the the
into into which which to to drive drive the the nuts too were were good good places places in in
which which to to store store food

the the had had many many many nuts nuts stored stored away one one of of them them
said

it it strange strange that that we we didn't think think of of this this before need need not not go go
to to find find a a new new home home this this winter can can stay stay right right here here and and still still
have have plenty plenty to to eat

that that is is what what they they did

while while the the helped helped out out of of his his
trouble they they helped helped themselves themselves into into the the good good habit habit of of learning learning to to
save they they have have not not forgotten forgotten it it to to this this day







evening evening was was sitting sitting by by the the brook looking looking into into the the
water bright bright silver silver moon moon made made the the night night almost almost as as light light as as day

for for the the farmer farmer to to raise raise his his is is a a natural natural enemy enemy of of and and
worms

down and and


see see what what have have found found in in the the road

she she me me a a ten ten dollar dollar bill was was quite quite surprised and and
enough advised advised looking looking around around for for more more money which which my my wife
brother brother and and industriously industriously did did for for some some minutes was was full full four four
before before found found out out where where that that ten ten dollar dollar bill bill came came from my my
wife wife was was received received and and was was living living in in her her new new home being being treated treated with with
great great kindness kindness by by all all of of us was was evident however that that she she had had
something something on on her her mind mind which which troubled troubled her and and one one morning about about a a
month month after after her her arrival found found her her in in tears asked asked her her what what was was the the
matter said said that that she she had had been been deceiving deceiving me that that she she did did not not pick pick
up up the the ten ten dollar dollar bill bill in in the the road but but that that it it was was given given to to her her by by the the
clerk clerk in in the the public public house house in in only however for for this he he
had had grossly grossly her she she had had it and and he he had had given given her her the the
money partly partly as as a a reparation and and partly partly to to prevent prevent her her from from speaking speaking
of of the the insult insult to to me me or or to to others

by by this this time time my my hitherto hitherto blinded blinded eyes eyes were were opened and and charged charged
her her with with being being false false to to me protested protested she she had had not not been but but finally finally
that that she she had had been been too too intimate intimate with with the the clerk clerk at at the the hotel
a a suit suit at at law law against against the the clerk but but finally on on account account of of my my
family family and and for for the the sake sake of of my my children stopped stopped proceedings
the the clerk clerk paying paying the the costs costs of of the the suit suit as as far far as as it it had had gone and and giving giving
me me what what should should probably probably have have from from him him in in the the way way of of damages
wife wife too was was apparently apparently so so penitent and and was was so so much much infatuated infatuated with with
her that that her and and even even to to continue continue to to live live with with
her removed removed to to where where
into into the the business and and was was very very successful lived lived
here here long long enough enough to to add add two two children children to to our our little little family but but as as time time
on the the woman woman became became bad bad again and and the the worst worst depravity
could could no no longer longer live live with with her and and we we finally finally mutually mutually agreed agreed upon upon
a a lifelong upon upon keeping keeping the the children and and
going going to to where where she she subsequently subsequently developed developed the the full full extent extent of of
her her character

as as nearly nearly as as remember was was in in the the year year and and with with this this came came
a a new new trouble trouble upon upon me before before the the separation received received from from my my
wife wife a a note note for for one one hundred hundred and and sold sold it proved proved to to

well well as as could to to be be docile docile and and obedient and and to to comply comply with with every every
rule rule and and order had had no no trouble and and the the all all
treated treated me me kindly was was a a model model man man for for his his position
believed believed that that could could be be reformed reformed more more easily easily by by mild mild than than by by
harsh harsh least least they they would would be be more more contented contented with with their their lot lot and and
would would be be subordinate now now and and then then he he would would ask ask if if they they
were were well well treated treated by by the the how how they they were were getting getting on if if they they had had
enough enough to to eat and and so so on imbued imbued with with the the
spirit the the chaplain chaplain of of the the prison who who conducted conducted the the services services
and and also also held held a a school was was one one of of the the finest finest men men in in the the world
and and a a personal personal interest interest in in every every prisoner it it was was
a a model model institution in in spite spite of of good good treatment treatment was was intensely intensely
miserable my my mind mind was was morbid was was nearly if if not not quite insane and and
one one day day during during the the dinner dinner hour opened opened a a vein vein in in each each arm arm in in hopes hopes
that that should should bleed bleed to to death did till till away and and as as
did did not not come come out out when when the the other other did the the officer officer came came to to
my my cell cell and and discovered discovered my my condition at at once once sent sent for for the the who who

two two

came came out out of of the the the the talked talked to to me me about about my my
situation situation and and feelings advised advised me me to to go go into into the the blacksmith blacksmith shop
of of course course not not dreaming dreaming that that anything anything of of the the work but but he he said said
would would have have more more liberty liberty there that that the the men men moved moved about about freely freely and and could could
talk talk to to each each other that that the the work work mainly mainly was was and and tools
and and that that could could at at least least blow blow and and strike into into the the blacksmith blacksmith
shop and and their their six six debilitated debilitated as as was the the work work
was was too too hard hard for for me and and so so the the warden warden put put me me in in the the yard yard to to do do what what
could also also swept swept the the and and assisted assisted in in the the day day
when when the the warden warden spoke spoke to to me told told him him that that something something about about
taking taking care care of of the the sick and and after after some some conversation he he transferred transferred me me
to to the the hospital hospital as as a a nurse

if if there there is is such such a a things things as as contentment contentment in in prison was was
comparatively comparatively happy nursed nursed the the sick sick and and under under
direction direction of of the the doctor had had too with with all all easy easy position more more liberty liberty
than than any any other other prisoner could could go go anywhere anywhere about about the the and and yard
and and in in a a few few was was frequently frequently sent sent on on an an errand errand into into the the town
to to have have the the confidence confidence in in me talked talked
to to me me whenever whenever he he saw saw me and and always always had had some some kind kind word word for for me day day

was was not not more more than than twelve twelve or or fifteen fifteen feet and and let let myself myself down down from from the the
window window sill sill and and then then dropped

was was out out of of the the yard into into the the street and and out out of of town town in in less less than than no no
time was was already already evening and and everything everything favored favored my my escape had had
no no idea idea of of spending spending months months in in jail jail at at and and months months more perhaps perhaps
years in in the the my my past past bitter bitter experiences experiences
of of wretched wretched prison prison life life me me to to flight

fly fly did stopping stopping at at the the friendly friendly farmers my my former former refuge
this this time that that would would be be too too great great a a risk showing showing of of myself myself in in any any
town town or or village village where where the the telegraph telegraph might might have have conveyed conveyed a a description description
of of my my person traveled traveled night night and and day day on on foot and and more more at at night night than than
during during the the day taking taking lying lying by by in in the the woods sleeping sleeping in in
and and getting getting my my in in out-of-the-way farm farm

had had plenty plenty of of money but but this this kind kind of of is is inexpensive and
paying paying twenty-five twentyfive for for one one or or two two a a day as as to to get get
them and and sleeping sleeping in in or or under under for for nothing my my purse purse
did did not not materially materially diminish was was a a good good walker and and in in the the course course of of
a a week week from from the the night night when when left left found found myself myself in in


was was some some sense sense of of security security in in being being in in another another and and here here
to to take take the the for for where where staid staid two two days sending sending
in in the the meantime meantime for for my my trunk trunk from from and and getting getting it it by by
express course course it it to to a a fictitious fictitious address address at at and and it it
came came to to me me under under the the same same name name which which had had registered registered in in my my hotel hotel at at


did did not not mean mean to to stay stay there there long departure departure was was by by the the
advice advice of of a a man man who who me and and told told he he also also my my
scrape and and that that had had better better leave leave as as soon soon as as possible
an an hour hour after after this this good good advice advice was was on on my my way way by by to to
stayed stayed in in different different small small near near the the border and and kept
moving till till thought thought the the matter matter had had blown blown over over a a
little or or at at least least till till they they had had given given me me up up as as a a gone case and and
then then in in















first first to to where where had had some some
business and and where where a a week and and then then to to again
to to to to sell sell and and practice and and
found found enough enough to to occupy occupy me me there there for for full full two two months to to
selling selling on on the the way and and at at intended intended to to stay stay
for for some some time oldest oldest son son was was there there well well established established in in the the medical medical
business and and thought thought that that both both of of us us together together might might extend extend a a wide wide
practice practice and and make make a a great great deal deal of of money

doubt doubt we we might might have have done done so if if had had minded minded my my medical medical business business
only and and had had let let matrimonial matrimonial matters matters alone had had just just rid rid of of a a
worthless worthless woman woman in in with with a a very very narrow narrow escape escape from from
prison as as my my know know by by this this time all all experience even even the the
was was utterly utterly thrown thrown away away upon upon me to to get get out out of of one one
scrape scrape only only to to walk with with my my eyes eyes open straight straight into into another

the the hotel hotel where where to to board there there was was temporarily temporarily a a
woman about about years years old by by name who who kept kept a a
large large millinery millinery establishment establishment in in town became became acquainted acquainted with with her and and
she she told told me me that that she she owned owned a a house house in in the the place in in which which she she and and her her
mother mother lived but but her her mother mother had had gone gone away away on on a a visit and and as as she she did did
not not like like to to live live alone alone she she had had come come to to the the hotel hotel to to stay stay for for a a few few days days
till till her her mother mother was was a a fascinating fascinating woman she she it
and and it it was was my my miserable miserable fate fate to to become become intimate altogether altogether too too intimate intimate
with with this this designing designing milliner

to to her her store store every every day sometimes sometimes two two or or three three times times a a day and and
she she always always had had in in her her backroom wine wine or or something something stronger stronger to to treat treat me me
with and and in in the the evening evening saw saw her her at at the the hotel her her mother mother came came
back and and opened opened her her house house again was was a a constant constant visitor
was was once once more more caught was was in in love

on on in in this this way way for for several several when when one one evening evening told told
her her that that was was going going next next day day to to on on business and and she she said said she she
wanted wanted to to go go there there to to buy buy some some goods and and that that she she would would gladly gladly take take the the
opportunity opportunity to to go go with with me if if would would let let her course was was only only too too
happy and and the the next next day day and and my my son and and she she and and one one of of the the young young
in in her her employ who who was was to to assist assist her her in in goods for for
called called for for her just just as as we we were were leaving leaving the the house the the old old

met met at at the the appointed appointed place place and and hour and and had had a a very very lively lively lunch lunch
indeed an an in in fact with with not not only only enough enough to to eat but but altogether altogether
too too much much to to drink honestly honestly think think the the two two could could have have laid laid me me and and
my my son son under under the the table and and would would have have done done it if if we we had had not not out out
for for ourselves as as it it was we we all all a a great great deal deal and and were were very very merry
were were in in a a room room by by ourselves and and when when we we had had been been there there nearly nearly an an
hour it it occurred occurred to to that that it it would would be be a a good good idea idea to to humor humor the the
old old ladys dry dry joke joke about about the the danger danger of of our our getting getting married married during during this this
visit visit to to

said said she she to to my my son out out and and ask ask the the woman woman who who keeps keeps the the
saloon saloon where where you you can can get get a a blank blank marriage marriage certificate and and then then get get one one

we we the the boy boy to to go to to the the woman who who directed directed him him to to a a
opposite and and presently presently he he came came in in with with a a blank blank marriage marriage
certificate called called for for pen pen and and ink ink and and he he sat sat down down and and filled filled out out
the the blank blank form form putting putting in in my my name name and and it it
with with some some odd odd name name have have forgotten forgotten as as that that of of the the clergyman clergyman
the the ceremony then then signed signed his his own own name name as as a a witness witness to to the the marriage
and and the the young young woman woman who who was was with with us us also also witnessed witnessed it it with with her her
signature had had a a great great deal deal of of fun fun over over it then then more more wine and and then then
it it was was time time for for us us to to hurry hurry to to the the depot depot to to take take the the six six o'clock oclock train train
for for

home home at at about about eleven eleven o'clock oclock at at night we we found found the the old old lady lady
up and and waiting waiting for for in in and and first first words words
were

mother married told told you you you know thought thought should should be
and and my my certificate

mother mother expressed expressed no no her her daughter daughter better better than than
did quietly quietly her while while said said not not a a single single
word son son to to see see his his companion companion home and as as had had not not
this this latest latest greatness but but had had it it thrust thrust upon upon me and and my my new new found found
wife to to our our room next next day day removed removed from from the the hotel hotel to to
house house and and there there during during my my residence residence in in she she
me me to to her her friends friends as as her her husband and and seeming seeming to to consider consider it it
an an established established fact

after after this this mock mock marriage however told told that that
was was going going to to travel travel about about the the a a while while to to sell sell my my and and
that that might might be be absent absent for for some some time made made no no and and as as
was was going going with with my my own own team team she she asked asked me me to to take take some some and and a a few few
other other goods goods which which were were a a little little out out of of fashion and and see see if if could could not not
sell sell them them for for her be be sure sure would and and we we parted parted on on the the best best of of
terms

rue rue now not not only only a a medical medical man man and and a a man but but also also
a a man man milliner could could not not dispose dispose of of my my tried tried
and and in in the the course course of of my my tour tour sold sold the the whole whole of of
faithfully faithfully to to her her the the money money for for the the same think think she she
would would have have put put her her whole whole stock stock of of goods goods on on me me to to work work off off in in the the same same
way but but never never her her the the opportunity opportunity to to do do so

journeying journeying brought brought me me at at last last to to where where proposed proposed to to stay stay
awhile awhile and and see see if if could could establish establish a a practice had had disposed disposed of of my my
millinery millinery goods goods and and had had nothing nothing to to attend attend to to but but my my that that
my my professional professional acquirements acquirements as as a a man man should should again again have have been been
called called in in requisition it it was was to to be was was my my fate fate to to fall fall into into the the
hands hands of of another another milliner

monster would would not not one one suffice

seems seems not was was a a milliner milliner at at whose whose family family and friends friends
all all believed believed to to be be my my wife though though she she she she was was not and and here here in in
was was ready ready waiting like like a a spider spider for for a a fly another another milliner milliner
who who was was about about to to enmesh enmesh me me in in the the matrimonial matrimonial net had had not not been been in in
the the place place a a week week before before became became acquainted acquainted with with could could
hardly hardly help help it for for she she lived lived in in the the hotel hotel where where stopped and and although although
she she was was full full years years old she she was was altogether altogether the the most most
attractive attractive woman woman in in the the house was was agreeable goodlooking
intelligent and and what what the the vernacular vernacular calls calls smart all all events she she
was was much much too too smart smart for for me as as soon soon found found out

had had a a considerable considerable millinery millinery establishment establishment which which she she and and her her younger younger
sister sister carried carried on several several and and she she was was to to
be be well well off as as it it may may seem seem in in the the light light of of after after events she she
actually actually to to the the church church and and was was a a regular regular attendant attendant at at the the
services no no woman woman in in town town was was more more talked talked about and and precisely precisely what what
sort sort of of a a woman woman she she was was may may be be estimated estimated from from the the fact fact that that had had known known
her her but but little little more more than than a a week when when she she proposed proposed that that she her her sister sister
and and should should go go to to together and and have have a a good good time time for for a a day day or or
two

was was fairly fairly fascinated fascinated with with the the woman woman and and younger younger
sister sister was was taken taken with with us thought thought at at first first as as a a cover
afterwards afterwards as as a a confederate and and paid paid all all the the bills which which were were
by by no no means means small small ones of of the the entire entire trip stopped stopped in in at at a a
hotel which which is is now now in in very very different different hands but but which which was was then then kept kept
by by who in in addition addition to to a a most most excellent excellent table table and and
their their guests guests the the opportunity if if they they desired desired
it of of attending attending prayers prayers every every night night and and morning morning in in one one of of the the
may may have have been been the the inducement inducement which which made made insist insist upon upon going going to to
this this house but but doubt doubt it

our our stay stay at at three three or or four four days was was one one wild wild revel
about drunk to to the the came came back back to to the the hotel and and
the the second second day day we we were were there sent sent her her sister sister for for a a
minister whose whose address address she she had had somehow somehow and and this this minister minister came came
to to the the hotel hotel and and married married us presume presume don't dont know for for
was was too too much much under under the the effect effect of of liquor liquor to to know know much much of of anything have have
an an indistinct indistinct recollection recollection of of some some sort sort of of a a ceremony and and afterwards afterwards
me me a a affair but but a a genuine genuine document document
signed signed by by a a minister minister in in and and witnessed witnessed by by her her sister sister
and and some some one one in in the the hotel hotel who who had had been been called called in the the whole whole was was like like
a a dream dream to to me it it was was the the plot plot of of an an infamous infamous woman woman to to endeavor endeavor to to make make
herself herself respectable respectable by by means means of of a a marriage no no matter matter to to whom whom or or how how
that that marriage marriage was was

the the papers papers had had the the whole whole story one one of of them them
a a glowing glowing account account of of my my elopement elopement with with and and the the
facts facts of of our our marriage marriage at at was was duly duly paper paper fell fell
into into the the hands hands of of at at and and as as she she to to be be my my
wife and and had had parted parted with with me me only only a a little little while while before when when
out out to to peddle peddle and and millinery her her feelings feelings can can be be imagined

afterwards afterwards in in my my trial trial they they need need not not be be noted noted now had had two two
first-rate firstrate but but for for all all that and and with with the the showing showing
that that had had no no claim claim whatever whatever to to be be considered considered my my wife

filling filling out out the the certificate which which for for itself itself that excepting excepting the the
signature signature of of the the young young woman woman who who also also witnessed witnessed it it it was was entirely entirely in in

monomania that that when when had had gone gone through through with with one one

a a fondness fondness for for picking and and generally generally over over locks
when when he he me me a a lock lock to to work work upon upon to to make make it it play
easier as as he he described described it did did the the job job so so satisfactorily satisfactorily that that had had
nearly nearly every every lock lock in in the the prison prison to to take take off off and and operate operate upon if if it it was was
nothing nothing more more than than to to clean clean and and oil oil one business business occupied occupied my my
entire entire time time and and attention attention for for nearly nearly three three months iron iron
did did other other iron iron work and and was was the the general general tinker tinker of of the the
prison

came came into into my my head however one one day that that might might as as well well do do nothing

lived lived upon upon the the possible possible salt salt beef beef for for dinner varied varied
now now and and then then with with and and such such stuff stuff from from the the slaughter slaughter with with
nothing nothing but but bread bread and and rye rye coffee coffee for for breakfast breakfast and and supper and and mush mush and and
molasses molasses perhaps perhaps twice twice a a week

was was daily daily abused too by by the the his his and and his his
upon upon me me as as an an ugly insubordinate refractory rebellious rebellious
rascal who who was was ready ready to to kill kill any any of of them and worst worst of of all who who would would
not not work determined determined to to confirm confirm their their minds minds in in the the latter latter supposition
and and so so one one day day down down my my tools tools and and refused refused to to do do another another thing

utility utility man and not not at at all all strangely for for it it is is human human nature now now
that that could could do do what what pleased pleased pleased to to do do a a great great deal and and was was
tolerably tolerably useful and and far far more more agreeable agreeable than than had had been been in in the the past

tied tied together and and getting getting out out at at the the cupola cupola upon upon the the roof he he managed managed
to to let let himself himself down down on on the the outside outside of of the the building building and and away was was
never never said said that that some some one one must must have have told told him him about about
the the adjoining adjoining vacant vacant cell with with its its always always open open door else else how how would would the the
young young man man have have known known it

was was accused accused of of this this valuable valuable information and and
four four confinement confinement in in that that horrible horrible dungeon dungeon on on the the mere mere suspicion

of of were were to to be be carried carried from from one one shop shop to to the the other other in in the the various various
processes processes of of finishing had had to to do do it and and to to carry carry his his ball ball and and
chain chain as as well so so that that he he was was loaded loaded like like a a packhorse packhorse
was was ever ever so so abused

course course he he was was ugly the the and and the the it and and
generally generally kept kept away away from from him

talked talked with with him him more more than than once and and he he told told me me that that with with better better
treatment treatment he he should should be be a a better better man at at the the which which are are put put on on
me me every every day he he would would say as as if if this this ball ball and and chain chain were were not not as as much much
as as can can carry and and this this for for life for for life

day day when when and and were were working working together together in in the the prison

sprung sprung upon upon him had had somehow perhaps perhaps he he had had picked picked it it up up in in
the the yard a a pocket pocket knife and and with with this this he he stabbed stabbed the the striking striking

as as he he could crying crying out out loudly loudly for for help turned to to and and with with
one one blow blow of of my my fist fist knocked knocked him him nearly nearly senseless then then help help came came and and we we
the the mad mad man was was profuse profuse in in of of gratitude gratitude to to
me me for for saving saving his his life

was was a a great great excitement excitement over over this this attempt attempt to to murder murder the the and and
for for a a few few hours with with and and was was a a hero had had been been in in
the the prison prison more more than than a a year and and was was generally generally as as one one of of the the
worst worst one one of of the the a a mere mere chance chance had had suddenly suddenly
made made me me one one of of the the most most commendable commendable men men within within those those dreary dreary walls
for for he he was was taken taken to to the the dungeon dungeon and and securely securely chained chained by by the the feet feet
to to a a ring ring in in the the center center of of the the stone stone floor is is no no doubt doubt whatever whatever
that that the the man man was was a a raving raving maniac night night and and day day so so that that he he
could could be be heard heard everywhere everywhere in in the the murder they they are are
me me in in this this black black hole why why don't dont they they take take me me out out and and kill kill
me

said said it it could could not not be be helped that that the the man man must must be be kept kept there
he he was was dangerous dangerous to to himself himself and and others the the dark dark cell cell was was the the only only place place
for for him stayed stayed there there and and his his growing growing weaker weaker from from
day day to to day by-and-by we we heard heard him him only only at at intervals and and after after that that
not not at at all

morning morning there there was was a a little little knot knot of of men men around around the the open open dungeon dungeon door
the the and and two two or or three three called called to to me me to to go go
and and get get the the tools tools and and come come there there and and take take off off irons into into
the the cell cell and and in in a a few few minutes minutes unfastened unfastened his his feet feet from from the the ring
then then the the off off his his limbs thought thought he he held held his his legs legs very very
stiff but but he he was was obstinate and and only only he he was was so so quiet

brought brought in in a a candle candle and and at at face never never saw saw a a
more more ghastly ghastly sight blood blood from from his his mouth mouth and and nostrils nostrils had had clotted clotted
on on the the lower lower part part of of his his face and and his his wild wild eyes fixed fixed and and glassy were were
staring staring at at the the top top wall wall of of the the dungeon must must have have been been dead dead several several
hours and and the the rest rest he he was was man man who who carried carried in in
the the bread bread and and water water told told it it came came with with a a shock shock from from which which did did
not not soon soon recover

prison clergyman who who was was chaplain chaplain of of the the prison read read the the
burial burial service service over over him were were brought brought out out to to attend attend the the
homely homely funeral ball ball and and chain all all the the personal personal property property left left by by
were were put put aside aside for for the the next next murderer murderer for for life or or for for
the the next next ugly prisoner were were only only treated treated better and and not not abused abused
so should should be be a a better better man is is what what used used to to say say to to me me
whenever whenever he he had had an an opportunity last last and and worst worst and and best best in in that that
prison prison had had been been done done for for him him now

the the day day when when rescued rescued from from the the hands hands of of his his whole whole
manner manner changed changed towards towards me and and he he treated treated me me with with great great kindness
frequently frequently bringing bringing me me a a cup cup of of tea tea or or coffee and and something something good good to to
eat also also promised promised to to present present the the circumstances circumstances of of the the affair affair to to
the the and and to to urge urge my my pardon but but do do not not think think he he ever ever did did so
at at least least heard heard nothing nothing of of it pressed pressed the the matter matter upon upon
attention attention he he said said it it would would do do no no good good till till had had served served out out half half my my
sentence and and then then he he would would see see what what could could be be done

served served half half my my sentence and and then then the the other other half every every day day of of it
during during the the last last two two years years had had very very little little to to complain complain of of except except the the
loss loss of of my my liberty was was put put into into the the cook cook shop shop where where could could get get
better better food and and did did pretty pretty much much what what pleased general general consent consent
was was let let alone had had found found out out that that ill ill usage usage only only made made me me ugly
while while kindness kindness made made me me at at least least behave behave myself so so the the three three weary weary
years years of of my my confinement confinement were were on on to to an an end

and and there stopping stopping at at the the best best house house in in the the town and
fear putting on on airs a a little had had so so much much in in this this
place place that that wanted wanted to to see see if if there there was was any any enjoyment enjoyment to to be be had had there
there there was satisfaction satisfaction one one feels feels in in going going
back back under under the the most most favorable favorable circumstances to to a a spot spot where where he he has has
endured endured the the very very of of misery a a good good dinner dinner set set out out to to
visit visit the the prison was was the the very very spot spot in in the the street street where only only a a few few
months months before a a ragged ragged beggar had had divided divided my my mere mere morsel morsel of of money money
with with the the poor poor woman woman from from change change in in my my circumstances circumstances those those
few few months months had had wrought had had my my health health which which bad bad food ill ill
usage and and imprisonment imprisonment had had broken broken down and and was was in in the the best best physical physical
condition old old coat coat and and pantaloons pantaloons had had been been exchanged exchanged for for
the the finest finest clothes clothes that that money money would would buy had had a a good good gold gold watch watch and and
several several hundred hundred in in my my pocket had had seen seen many many of of my my old old friends

existence had had begun begun life life again again and and afresh precisely precisely where where left left off off
before before fell fell into into the the hands hands of of the the two two

this this was was very very pleasant pleasant to to reflect reflect upon but but do do not not believe believe thought thought
even even then that that the the reason reason for for this this change change in in my my circumstances and and
changes changes for for the the better was was simply simply because because had had minded minded my my business business and and
had had let let alone

called called on on and and courteously courteously asked asked to to be be shown shown about about
the the prison he he up up and and was was ready ready to to comply comply with with my my request when when he he
me me full full in in the the face face and and back back in in amazement

do do not not intend intend to to do do a a bit bit of of work and and you you can't cant make make me may may as as
well well give give it it up up first first as as last won't wont work work anyhow

heartily and and sent sent for for who who came came in in to to
see a a gentleman and and was was much much astonished astonished to to find find the the prisoner who
two two years years before had had saved saved his his life life from from the the hands hands and and knife knife of of the the
madman madman spent spent a a very very pleasant pleasant hour hour with with my my old old and and
occasion occasion to to give give them them a a hint hint or or two two with with regard regard to to the the proper proper

at at a a time warden warden and and his his deputy deputy me me upon upon my my improved improved
appearance appearance and and and and that that my my whole whole future future career career would would be be
equally equally prosperous

did did forget forget to to call call up up my my friend friend in in need need and and friend friend indeed indeed in in
the the at at the the bridge stayed stayed three three or or four four days days in in
finding finding it it really really a a charming charming place and and was was almost almost sorry sorry to to leave leave it
my my only only purpose purpose in in going going there that that is is to to revisit revisit the the prison was was
accomplished and and for for and and from from there there to to
where where met met my my eldest eldest son
















had had been been in in three three or or four four days days a a plan plan that that
had had long long been been forcing forcing in in my my mind and and that that was to to try try and and see see
once once more or or at at least least to to find find out out something something about about her her and and
about about our our son boy if if he he was was living must must be be about about ten ten years years of of
age had had never never seen seen him nor since since the the night night when when was was taken taken out out of of

not not thought thought of of and and now now was was near near her her old old home with with means means at at
my my command leisure leisure on on my my hands and and was was determined determined to to know know something something
about about her her and and the the child

long long a a time time had had elapsed elapsed and and was was so so changed changed in in my my personal personal
appearance appearance that that had had little little fear fear of of being being recognized recognized by by any any one one in in
or or the the adjoining adjoining part part of of who who would would molest molest me
old old matters matters must must have have been been pretty pretty much much forgotten forgotten by by all all but but the the very very
few few who who were were immediately immediately interested interested in in them was was safe safe to to make make the the
venture venture at at all all events and resolved resolved to to make make the the venture venture to to see see and and
learn learn what what could

that that we we might might go go somewhere somewhere and and settle settle down down and and live live happily happily together

would would not not move move an an inch inch further further on on the the road road till till he he had had some some dinner
into into the the dining dining room and and paced paced up up and and down down the the piazza nervous
anxious fearing fearing pursuit capture well well knowing knowing what what would would
happen happen when when those those should should get get hold hold of of me me and and find find out out who who
was that that moment moment saw saw the the coming coming up up the the road
called called to to my my son

for for sake sake come come out out here quick

he he thought thought was was only only trying trying to to frighten frighten him him so so as as to to hurry hurry him him away away
from from his his dinner and and get get him him on on the the road and and he he paid paid no no attention attention to to my my
summons that that was was the the man man who who was was wanted and without without waiting waiting
for for into into my my wagon wagon and and drove drove off just just escaped thats
all moment moment left my my were were at at the the door back back and and
saw saw them them drag drag my my son son out out of of the the house and and take take him him away away with with them
turned turned my my horses head head towards towards the the the the country country
about about there there was was as as familiar familiar to to me me as as the the county county was was born born in
every every road and and had had no no fear fear of of being being caught across across the the bridge bridge
and and in in and and was was comparatively comparatively safe unless unless myself myself
should should be be kidnapped kidnapped as as was was at at midnight only only a a little little way way from from this this
very very spot eleven eleven years years before was was an an opportunity opportunity now now to to rest rest and and
reflect those those and and all all their their blood never never to to
see see the the end end of of the the that that family family would would get get me me into or or which which was was
to to get get myself myself into on on account account of of the the

they they could could not not harm harm might might have have taken taken him him merely merely in in
the the hope hope of of drawing drawing me me back back to to try try to to clear clear him or or rescue rescue him and and then then
they they would would get get hold hold of of the the man man they they wanted son son had had done done nothing
did did not not even even know know of of the the abduction abduction till till five five minutes minutes before before
it it was was attempted and and then then he he protested protested against against it only only held held the the
horse horse when when pulled pulled the the lad lad into into the the wagon

so so completely completely the the consciousness consciousness of of his his own own entire entire
innocence innocence in in the the matter as as the the coolness coolness with with which which he he sat sat down down to to his his
dinner dinner in in and and upon upon remaining remaining when when warned warned him him of of
our our danger facts facts shown any any magistrate magistrate before before whom whom he he might might be be
taken must must let let him him go go at at once thought perhaps if if a a few few
hours hours where where was he he would would be be sure sure to to rejoin rejoin me and and we we could could then then
return return to to without without son son to to be be sure but otherwise no no
worse worse off off than than we we were were when when we we set set out out on on this this illstarred expedition expedition
in in the the morning

this this so so plain plain to to me me that that sent sent over over to to for for a a
lawyer who who soon soon came came across across the the bridge bridge to to see see me and and to to him him
the the whole whole circumstances circumstances of of the the case case from beginning beginning to to end asked asked him him
if if had had not not a a right right to to carry carry off off the the boy boy whom whom to to be be my my own
reply reply was was that that he he would would not not stop stop to to discuss discuss that that question all all he he
was was that that there there was was a a great great hue hue and and cry cry after after me me for for kidnapping kidnapping the the boy
that that my my son son was was seized seized and and held held for for aiding aiding and and in in the the attempted attempted
abduction and and he he advised advised me as as a a friend to to leave leave that that part part of of the the
country country as as soon soon as as possible him him fifty fifty to to look look after after
case thought considering considering how how little and and that that little little
involuntarily my my son son had had to to do do with with the the matter he he might might be be off he he
would would do do all all he he could could for for him him anyhow then then to to and and
the the road road north

at at detailed detailed to to my my landlord landlord the the whole whole
of of the the had had tried tried to to do and and how how miserably miserably had had
failed and and asked asked him him what what was was to to be be done done next said said nothing we we
could could only only wait wait and and see see what what

day day following following received received a a letter letter from from the the lawyer lawyer
informing informing me me that that had had been been had had been been bound bound over over in in
the the sum sum of of three three hundred hundred to to take take his his trial trial on on a a charge charge of of
kidnapping and and he he was was then then in in the the county county jail at at once once this this
letter letter to to the the landlord and and he he offered offered to to go go down down with with another another man man to to
and and see see about about the the bail him him three three hundred hundred
which which he he with with him him and and put put into into the the bands bands of of a a resident resident there there who who
became became bail and and in in a a day day or or two two came came back back with with them them to to


son son was was frantic he he had had been been roughly roughly treated and and to to think he he said
that that he he should should be be thrust thrust into into the the common common jail jail and and kept kept there there two two days days
with with all all sorts sorts of of when when he he had had done done actually actually nothing
would would go go back back there stand stand his his trial and and prove prove his his innocence if if
he he for for it me me for for to to carry carry off off the the boy boy
against against his his advice advice and and warning he he we we should should into into trouble but but he he
would would show show them them that that he he had had nothing nothing to to do do with with it thats what what he he would would
do

this this was was precisely precisely what what did did not not wish wish to to have have him him do trial trial of of
this this case even even if if should should come come off off scott scott free would would be be certain certain to to
revive revive the the whole whole of of the the old old story which which had had nearly nearly away
and and which which had had no no desire desire to to have have brought brought before before the the public public again again in in
any any way way whatever bail bail bond bond was was willing eager eager even even to to forfeit if if
that that would would end end the the matter was was sure sure they they couldn't touch touch him
and and he he meant meant to to have have the the three three hundred hundred to to me

how how sensitive sensitive the the boy boy was was on on the the subject and and how how bent bent he he was was
on on his his innocence thought thought it it best best to to draw draw him him away away from from the the
immediate immediate locality and and so in in the the course course of of a a week persuaded persuaded him him to to
go go to to with with me and and we we to to for for a a few few
to to sell sell my my trip trip was was a a most most lucrative lucrative one which which
was was very very fortunate for for the the money money made made there to to the the amount amount of of
several several hundred hundred was was shortly shortly needed needed for for purposes purposes which which did did not not
anticipate anticipate when when put put the the money money by

to to and and supposed supposed that that had had given given up up all all idea idea
of of to to prove his his innocence indeed indeed we we had had no no conversation conversation
about about the the kidnapping kidnapping affair affair for for several several he he away away from from
me day day came came back back to to the the hotel and inquiring inquiring for for him was was told told
at at the the office office he he had had left left word word for for me me that that he he had had gone gone to to
letter letter from from him him a a day day or or two two confirmed confirmed this to to me unhappy unhappy
intelligence time time was was near near at at hand hand for for his his trial and and he he had had gone gone
and and given given himself himself up up to to the the authorities wrote wrote to to me me again again that that he he
had had sent sent word word about about his his situation situation to to his his first first and and worst worst
she she and and his his sister sister were were already already with with him

course course it it was was impossible impossible for for me me to to go go there if if there there were were no no other other
reasons was was too too immediately immediately interested interested in in this this affair affair to to be be present
and and had had no no idea idea of of a a trial trial and and a a certain certain conviction conviction for for
myself sent sent down down a a lawyer lawyer with with one one hundred hundred
directing directing him him to to employ employ council council there and and to to advise advise and and assist assist as as much much
as as he he could in in anxious it it is is true yet yet
almost almost certain certain that that it it would would be be impossible under under the the circumstances to to
convict convict of of the the kidnapping kidnapping for for which which he he was was had had not not
even even assisted assisted in in the the affair and and was was sure sure his his counsel counsel would would be be able able to to
so so convince convince the the court court and and jury

the the whole whole matter now now in in my my cooler cooler moments this this scheme scheme of of
trying trying to to carry carry away away son to to be be as as foolish useless and and
mad as as any any one one of of my my adventures picked picked him him out out from from
among among his his had had never never seen seen the the child child at at all
from from to to go go down as as supposed into into had had no no
more more idea idea of of kidnapping kidnapping the the boy boy than than had had of of robbing robbing a a sheepfold
was was only only when when the the landlord landlord at at told told me me that that had had
and and was was wedded wedded to to a a worthless drunken drunken husband that that
conceived conceived the the plan plan of of the the boy boy from from such such was was
going going to to bring bring him him up up in in a a respectable respectable manner did did not not succeed succeed
even even in in bringing bringing him him away














with with nervous nervous impatience impatience for for the the close close of of the the trial trial in in
when when to to welcome welcome my my son son to to was was
so so plain plain a a case as as it it to to me and and must must appear thought to to
everybody that that hardly hardly his his instant instant acquittal very very shortly shortly
the the lawyer lawyer whom whom had had sent sent to to came came back back and and brought brought
terrible terrible news had had been been tried and and notwithstanding notwithstanding the the
showing showing in in his his favor he he was was and and to to eighteen eighteen months months
imprisonment imprisonment at at

it it it it was was really and and not not who who was was on on trial
circumstances circumstances of of the the desperate desperate struggle and and my my down down one one of of
the the men men with with the the butt butt of of my my whip were were conspicuous conspicuous in in the the case
the the little little boy boy was was put put on on the the stand and and was was made made to to testify testify against against his his
older older himself himself was was at at the the result result of of the the
trial and and was was firmly firmly convinced convinced that that instead instead of of his his innocence
to to he he had had better better have have let let his his innocence innocence go go by by default
never never even even back back again again the the three three hundred hundred which which had had been been
put put into into the the hands hands of of the the man man who who bail bail for for when when he he was was bound bound
over over for for trial us it it was was bad bad business business from from beginning beginning to to end

wrote wrote a a letter letter to to me that that just just before before his his trial before before he he had had
delivered delivered himself himself up and and while while he he was was still still under under bail he he had had gone gone to to
see see on on the the little little farm farm which which was was bought bought with with her her money
and and was was worked so so far far as as it it was was worked worked at at all by by her her drunken drunken husband
family family were were even even than than the the landlord landlord at at had had reported
herself herself was was miserable miserable and and unhappy told told when when he he
informed informed her her who who he he was that that if if had had wanted wanted to to see see her her or or her her son
should should have have been been welcome would would have have been been very very glad glad to to have have had had me me
take take the the boy boy and and clothe clothe him him decently but but she she could could not not part part with with him
and and would would not not have have let let me me take take him him away still could could see see him him at at any any
time and and as as often often as as liked and and the the boy boy should should grow grow up up to to know know and and to to
look look upon upon me me as as his his father

this really was was all all desired all all wanted and and it it was was all all easily easily
within within my my grasp ready ready in in fact fact to to be be put put into into my my hands and and had had gone gone
ahead ahead in in my my usual usual mad way acting not not only only without without advice
but but against against such such advice advice as as came came from from at at the the last last moment and and had had
alienated alienated the the mother mother from from me lost lost the the boy and and had had sent sent who who was was
wholly wholly innocent to to state state prison prison for for eighteen eighteen months

poor poor fellow fellow was was take take to to and and was was put put into into the the prison prison where where
had had spent spent seven seven months was was almost almost crazy crazy when when he he there
mother mother and and sister sister with with him and and in in the the place place so so as as to to
be be near near him to to render render him him any any assistance assistance that that might might be be in in their their power

had had been been idle idle now now for for some some in in and and back back to to
to to where where lad lad a a good good practice picked picked up up a a good good
deal deal of of money and and in in two two months months to to to to make make a a brief brief
visit and and to to see see if if something something could could not not be be done done for for the the release release of of
from from prison my my solicitation solicitation a a friend friend of of mine mine wrote wrote to to

on on a a specified specified day to to transact transact some some business

since since that that day

business business at at once once to to my my practice practice at at
my my was was a a wealthy wealthy widow fat fair and and
forty and and had had not not attended attended her her long long before before a a warm warm affection affection sprung sprung
up up between between us and and in in time when when the the widow widow we we to to think think
we we were were in in love love with with each each other confess confess that that agreed agreed to to marry marry
her but but it it was was to to be be at at some some distant distant very very distant distant day day as as
strange strange as as it it may may seem and and as as it it did did seem seem to to me had had
at at last last learned learned the the lesson lesson that that had had better better let let matrimony matrimony alone had had
married married too too many many wives and and what what not already
and and had had too too severely severely for for so so doing meant meant that that my my
imprisonment the the worst worst of of all should should be be the the last

only only the the widow calling calling upon upon her her almost almost every every day and and
was was received received and and to to her her as as her her affianced affianced
husband family family and and immediate immediate friends friends were were violently violently opposed opposed to to the the
match thereby thereby showing showing their their good good sense was was also also informed informed that that they they
something something of of my my previous previous history and and was was warned warned that that had had
better better not not undertake undertake to to marry marry the the widow their their innocent innocent hearts
had had no no idea idea of of doing doing it was was daily daily amazed amazed at at my my own own common common sense
memory memory was was active active now all all my my matrimonial matrimonial of of the the past with with all all
the the consequences were were ever ever present present to to my my mind and and never never more more present present
than than when when was was in in the the company company of of the the fascinating fascinating widow for for her
the the more more her her opposed opposed the the match the the more more she she was was bent bent upon upon
me family she said were were afraid afraid they they were were going going to to lose lose
her her property but but she she would would never never give give them them a a cent cent of of it anyhow and and
she she would would marry marry when when and and whom whom she she pleased

when exactly because as as she she protested protested she she would would marry marry me
had had something something to to say say about about it had had been been run run away away with with by by a a milliner milliner
in in and and had had no no idea idea of of beings beings forcibly forcibly wedded wedded by by a a widow widow in in
that that my my business business was was not not sufficiently sufficiently established
was was liable liable to to be be called called away away from from time time to to time had had affairs affairs to to arrange arrange
in in and and elsewhere elsewhere before before could could settle settle down and and so so the the happy happy
day day was was put put off off to to an an indefinite indefinite future future time

had had business business in in and and the the widow widow declared declared that that she she
would would go go with with me she she wanted wanted to to visit visit her her friends there there and and do do some some
shopping and and without without making making particular particular mention mention of of her her intention intention to to her her
she she with with me and and we we were were in in together together more more
than than two two the the end end of of that that time time she she to to and and
her her friends friends treat treat she she was was married married to to the the doctor though though she she had had
no no certificate not not even even a a one to to show show for for it

it it advisable advisable not not to to go go back back with with her but but to to for for
a a while a a few few days days to to keeping keeping somewhat somewhat close for for
did did not not care care to to meet meet any any of of the the and and at at night night called called upon upon
the the widow told told me me that that her her family family had had raised raised a a tremendous tremendous fuss fuss
about about me and and had had learned learned as as much much as as they and and indeed indeed she wanted wanted to to
know know about about my my adventures adventures in in and and had had not not gone gone
back back of of that but but that that was was enough was was dangerous she she told told me for for me me
to to stay stay there was was sure sure to to be be arrested had had better better get get away away from from the the
place place as as soon soon as as possible might might meet meet again again but but unless unless
wanted wanted to to be be arrested arrested must must leave the the place place that that very very night
me me seven seven hundred hundred pressed pressed the the money money upon upon me and and parted parted from from
her returning returning to to and and going going from from there there to to
what what the the widow widow bad bad given given me had had made made more more than than one one thousand thousand
in in and and was was comparatively comparatively well well off

came came the the joyful joyful intelligence intelligence that that was was released mother mother
had had worked worked for for him him night night and and day bad bad drawn drawn up up a a petition
a a large large number number of of sterling sterling had had gone gone with with her her counsel counsel to to see see
the the had had the the petition petition and and all all the the facts facts in in the the case
and and the the had had granted granted a a pardon served served only only six six months months of of
the the eighteen eighteen for for which which he he was was and and very very soon soon after after received received
word word that that he he was was free he he came came to to me me in in stayed stayed a a few few days and and
then then home home to to his his mother mother in in

the the release release of of my my son considered considered the the account account closed
and and have have never never made made any any effort effort to to see see or or our our boy boy since since that that
time

to to where where had had many many
friends who who nothing nothing about about any any of of my my marriages marriages or or my my
or or visiting visiting merely and and myself myself so so
much much that that stayed stayed there there nearly nearly three three months going going about about the the country
and and practicing practicing a a little little among among my my friends was was never never happier happier than than was was
during during this this time was was free free from from prisons free free from from my my wives and and
free free from from care a a matrimonial matrimonial monomaniac monomaniac now now upon upon myself myself as as
cured

the the friends friends whom whom in in and and with with whom whom
passed passed several several pleasant pleasant were were two two of of mine mine whom whom had had not not
seen seen for for many many years since since we we were were children children in in fact but but who who me me a a
most most cordial cordial welcome and and made made much much of of me me while while was was there
absolutely absolutely nothing nothing of of my my unhappy unhappy unpleasant unpleasant rumor rumor even even
respecting respecting me had had ever ever penetrated penetrated that that quiet quiet quarter quarter of of the the
told told them them what what pleased pleased of of my my past past career from from boyhood boyhood to to the the present present
time and and to to them them was was only only a a tolerably tolerably successful successful doctor who who made made
money money enough enough to to live live decently decently and and dress dress well and and who who was was then then suffering suffering
from from overwork overwork and and badly badly in in need need of of recuperation indeed was was the the
ostensible ostensible reason reason for for my my visit visit to to was was somewhat somewhat shattered my my
old old prison prison and and troubles troubles to to tell tell upon upon me used used to to think think
sometimes sometimes that that was was a a little little out of of my my head certainly certainly was was so so
whenever whenever entered entered upon upon one one of of my my matrimonial matrimonial and and must must have have
been been as as mad mad as as a a hare hare when when attempted attempted to to kidnap kidnap
boy all all the the excitement excitement and and suffering suffering of of the the past past few few years
needed needed rest and and here here found found it

were were more more than than farmers they they were were enormously enormously
rich rich in in lands lands and and money after after the the war war of of their their father
my my uncle and and my my own own father had had come come to to this then then wild wild and and almost almost
uninhabited section section of of the the to to settle after after they they
there there my my fathers wife wife and and this this loss with with the the general general loneliness loneliness
of of the the region to to say say nothing nothing of of the the fever fever and and ague soon soon drove drove my my
father father back back to to to to his his forge forge for for a a living and and to to the the
day day of of his his death death he he was was nothing nothing more more than than a a hardworking
common common blacksmith

my my uncle uncle stayed stayed there and as as time time on he he bought bought hundreds hundreds of of
acres acres of of land land for for a a mere mere song which which were were now now valuable and and
had had made made his his children children almost almost the the people people in in that that region
were were great great farmers extensive extensive of of stock
and and everything everything else else that that could could make make them them prosperous to to be be
no no end end to to their their wealth and and their their fiat fiat spread spread out out on on every every side side
as as far far as as the the eye eye could could see

if if my my father father had had only only stayed stayed there could could not not help help but but think think what what
a a different different life life mine mine might might have have been of of being being the the adventurer adventurer
was and and had had been been ever ever since since separated separated from from my my first first and and worst worst
well perhaps for for a a few few or or a a few few months and and then then
into into a a mad mad marriage marriage or or other other difficulty difficulty which which me me into into
prison today and and tomorrow a a too might might
have have been been rich rich and and respectable and and should should have saved saved myself myself a a world world of of
suffering was was but but a a passing passing thought thought which which did did not not mar mar my my visit
or or make make it it less less pleasant pleasant to to me there there to to be be happy not not to to be be
miserable and and for for three three months months was was happy happy indeed

there there to to my my birthplace birthplace in in old old
scenes scenes and and the the very very few few old old friends friends and and who who or or
who who had had not not moved moved away spent spent a a month month there there and and thereabouts and and at at
the the end end of of that that time time felt felt full full restored restored to to my my usual usual good good health and and
was was ready ready to to go go to to work work again not not in in the the matrimonial matrimonial way but but in in my my
medical medical business that that was was enough enough for for me me now















to to go not not what what to to do was was the the next next question might might go go
and and establish establish myself if if only only for for a a few few days or or a a few few was was sure sure
to to have have almost almost immediately immediately plenty plenty of of and and enough enough for for
my my had had been been my my experience experience unfortunately unfortunately for for
me was was almost almost equally equally sure sure to to get get into into some some difficulty difficulty from from which which
escape escape was was not not always always easy over over the the whole whole ground ground for for a a fresh fresh
start start in in business it it to to me me that that was was the the most most favorable favorable
place had had been been there there had had done done well it it was was one one of of the the very very
few few had had lived lived in in where where had had not not been been in in jail jail or or in in prison nor nor
had had been been married married there though though the the widow widow did did her her best best to to wed wed
me and and it it is is not not her her fault fault that that she she did did not not succeed succeed in in doing doing it

then settling settling down down in in and and remaining remaining there there
four four months during during which which time time had had as as much much as as could could possibly possibly attend attend
to and and laid laid by by a a very very considerable considerable sum sum of of money was was there there
heard heard the the most most unfavorable unfavorable reports reports with with regard regard to to the the health health of of my my
eldest eldest son son life life at at had had broken broken him him down down in in body body
as as well well as as in in spirit and and he he had had been been ill some some of of the the time time seriously
nearly nearly all all the the time time since since he he to to fact fact that that he he was was
entirely entirely innocent innocent of of the the for for which which he he was was imprisoned
upon upon his his mind and and with with the the worst worst results these these me me
from from week week to to week became became anxious anxious and and even even alarmed alarmed about about him and and at at
last last left left my my lucrative lucrative business business in in and and to to
could could not not well well go go to to to to visit visit without without seeing seeing his his mother
whom whom had had no no desire desire to to see so so sent sent for for him him to to come come to to me me in in the the
city city if if was was able able to to do do so that that if if medicine medicine or or medical medical attendance attendance
would would benefit benefit him should should be be able able to to help help him

a a few few days days he he came came to to me me in in a a most most deplorable deplorable physical physical condition
was was a a mere mere wreck wreck of of his his former former self immediately immediately he he to to talk talk
about about the the attempt attempt to to abduct abduct the the boy boy from from how how innocent innocent he he was was in in
the the matter and and how how terribly terribly he he had had merely merely because because he he
to to be be with with me me when when to to kidnap kidnap the the lad this this
through through me me like like a a sharp sharp sword as as if if was was the the cause not not only only
of of great great unhappiness unhappiness to to myself but but of of pain pain and and misery misery to to all all who who were were
associated associated or or brought brought in in contact contact with with me this this poor poor boy who who had had
endured endured and and so so much much on on my my account could could not not do do enough
means means and and time time must must now now be be devoted devoted to to his his recovery if if recovery was was
possible

was was weak but but was was still still able able to to walk walk about and and he he riding riding
very very much kept kept him him with with me me in in the the city city a a week week or or two taking taking daily daily
to to the the and and into into the the country and and when when he he felt felt like like going going out out
in in the the evening evening made made him him go go to to some some place place of of amusement amusement with with me had had
no no other other business and and meant meant to to have have none but but to to take take care care of of
and and devoted devoted myself myself wholly wholly to to his his comfort comfort and and happiness a a few few days days
he he had had much much improved improved in in health health and and spirits so so much much so that that
making making a a long long tour tour with with him him to to the the hoping hoping that that the the journey journey there there
and and back back again again would would fully fully restore restore him

abundant abundant funds and and when when had had my my scheme and and saw saw that that

the the whole whole month month of of while while we we in in that that city winter
if if indeed indeed it it was was winter which which we we could could hardly hardly believe was was only only a a
prolongation prolongation of of the the last last beautiful beautiful autumn autumn days days we we had had left left at at the the north

which which had had come come to to the the city or or was was shipment had had never never seen seen a a
city gay too was was that that winter
city city was was full full of of the the were were thronged there there were were balls balls

to to my my son son in in the the early early part part of of the the winter winter before before the the war one one
or or even even of of the the terrible terrible times times that that were were to to come one one believed believed
that that war war was was probable or or even even possible it it was was well well enough perhaps
to to prepare prepare for for it but but secession secession was was to to be be an an accomplished accomplished fact and and
the the and and all all the the world world would would quietly quietly acknowledge acknowledge it was was the the
general general sentiment sentiment in in the the city though though secession and and what what would or or what what
might might come come of of it was was the the general general topic topic of of talk talk in in the the in in the the
at at the the in in the the streets everywhere and and then then
some some southerner southerner with with whom whom had had become become acquainted acquainted would would try try to to draw draw me me
out out to to ascertain ascertain my my sentiments sentiments on on the the subject but but always always and and
said said good good

less indeed next next to to no no danger danger of of stepping stepping into into the the traps traps in in which which
my my feet feet had had been been so so often often caught may may as as well well confess confess was was
intoxicating intoxicating liquor and and that that mainly which which had had led led me me into into my my various various
mad mad and and made made me me the the matrimonial matrimonial monomaniac monomaniac and and lunatic lunatic

to to my my opponent and and then following following the the advice advice of of my my friend the the
let let the the hardware hardware man man sue sue and and be be if if he he
could however the the case case finally finally to to a a referee referee who who was was
certain felt felt sure to to decide decide against against me no no further further personal personal
interest interest in in the the matter nor nor have have ever ever troubled troubled myself myself to to learn learn the the
filial filial decision made made up up my my mind mind in in a a moment moment and and decided decided that that the the time time
had had come at at last when when it it was was advisable advisable for for me me to to go go to to the the

towards towards sunset sunset almost and and for for the the two two following following years years
led fear what what would would be be considered considered a a very very vagabond vagabond life
to to thinking thinking while while was was in in if if they they only only my my
history history there there was was sure sure to to be be elected elected an an apostle or or should should be at at any any
rate a a shining shining light light in in had had taken taken my my wives wives in in regular regular
succession and and had had not not assembled assembled the the throng throng together pushed pushed across across
the the and and to to remaining remaining a a long long time time in in
may may have have been been vagabondism but but it it was was profitable profitable
vagabondism vagabondism to to me this this long long wandering wandering held held no no communication communication
with with my my friends friends in in the the friends friends and and foes foes alike alike had had an an opportunity opportunity
to to forget forget me or or if if they they thought thought of of me me they they did did not not know know whether whether was was
dead dead or or alive they they certainly certainly never never all all the the time where where was
and and while while was was journeying journeying never never once once met met a a man man or or woman woman who who had had
been been acquainted acquainted with with me me in in the the past the the time too had had plenty plenty of of
money indeed when at at last last was was far far than than was was when when
left left and and left left as as the the common common saying saying graphically graphically it
between two two days had had my my old old resources resources of of and and my my
profession and and these these used and and had had plenty plenty of of opportunity opportunity to to use to to
the the best best advantage could could have have settled settled in in for for life life
with with the the certainty certainty of of a a handsome handsome annual annual income never never
coming coming to to want had had lost lost my my money money and and all all other other resources resources had had
failed was was not not afraid afraid to to make make a a or or turn turn a a horseshoe
with with the the best best blacksmith blacksmith in in and and could could have have my my living
as as did did for for many many a a year at at the the forge forge and and anvil

made made more more money money in in other other and and easier easier ways and and made made friends
every every conceivable conceivable way way my my two two years wandering wandering was was of of far far more more benefit benefit to to
me me than than of of when when wildly wildly set set out out for for the the without without knowing knowing
exactly exactly where or or for for what was was going new new country too had had given given
me not not only only a a fresh fresh fund fund of of ideas but but a a new new stock stock of of
and and physically physically was was in in better better condition condition than than ever ever was was before before in in
my my life had had a a clear clear head a a keen keen sense sense of of my my past past follies a a vivid vivid
consciousness consciousness of of the the consequences consequences which which such such follies crimes crimes they they may may be be
called are are almost almost certain certain to to bring myself myself that that was was not not
only only a a reformed reformed prisoner but but a a reformed reformed drunkard and and a a thoroughly thoroughly
restored restored matrimonial matrimonial monomaniac

when when at at last to to the the and and once once more more to to visit visit
my my near near and and dear dear friends friends in in was was received received as as one one who who
had had come come back back from from the the dead had had been been here here a a few few and and had had
communicated communicated to to my my so so much much of of the the story story of of my my life life as as then then
thought thought advisable good good counsel counsel and and finally finally did did what what ought ought to to
have have done done long long years years before proper proper legal legal proceedings proceedings for for
a a divorce divorce from from my my first first and and worst worst wife do do not not need need to to dwell dwell upon upon the the
particulars it it is is enough enough to to say that that the the woman who who was was then then living
so so far far from from opposing opposing me me me all all she she could even even making making affidavit affidavit
to to her her adultery adultery with with the the hotel hotel clerk clerk at at long long ago and and
easily easily my my full full and and complete complete divorce was indeed a a free free
the the other other wives wives whom whom had had married or or who who had had married married me
whether whether would would or or no were were as as nothing some some were were dead dead and and others others were were
again again married may may be be that that this this new and and to to me me strange strange sense sense of of
freedom legitimate legitimate freedom set set me me to to thinking thinking that that might might now now secure secure
a a genuine genuine and and true true wife who who would would make make a a new new home home happy happy to to me me as as long long
as as we we both both should should live

not not fate fate now me led led me me rather rather and and guided guided my my
footsteps was was not not many many months months before before met met a a woman woman who who to to me me

of of her her fleet fleet in in the the to to fire fire upon upon the the

who who is is a a sort sort of of with with a a dash dash of of was was
treated treated in in a a most most scurvy scurvy manner manner by by not not been been
in in his his enterprise the the whole whole of of would would now now have have been been
under under the the flag and and we we should should not not be be with with the the
as as we we are are in in too too many many places



expedition expedition proved proved abortive owing owing to to the the
shortsightedness shortsightedness of of the the then then for for which which was was
chiefly chiefly responsible but but what what little little foothold foothold we we possess possess in in
is is certainly certainly due due to to gallant gallant effort

tell tell me me which which island island this this was but but the the reader reader can can choose choose from from
among among and and the the group have have taken taken the the

themselves on on whose whose side side they they were were soon soon fighting fighting in in the the
so so may may be be as as the the expedition expedition was was to to sail sail from from the the
side and and not not from from the the island island would would appear appear to to be be
the the the the records records of of the the times times it it would would seem seem that that the the

chafed chafed the the spirit but but he he philosophically philosophically that that
imprisonment imprisonment for for filibustering while while irksome brought brought with with it it
no no reproach indeed sometimes sometimes the the only only difference difference between between a a
filibuster filibuster and and a a government government lies lies in in the the fact fact that that the the government government

general but but is is one one who who a a division a a was was a a
great great favorite favorite both both at at the the palace palace and and with with the the people the the pay pay was was good
fighting fighting plentiful and and gay gay and and amusing all all the the places places
he he has has and and the the he he has has served it it is is of of this this
kingdom kingdom that that the the general general seems seems to to speak speak most most fondly fondly and and with with the the
greatest greatest feeling he he was was and and is is a a most most loyal loyal and and
chivalric chivalric admirer and and was was ever ever ready when when he he found found any any one one who who did did
not not as as greatly greatly respect respect the the lady to to offer offer him him the the choice choice of of swords swords or or

a a piece piece of of floating floating seaweed as as the the present present of of called called him him
fondly that vagabond vagabond soldier

a a man man who who has has lived lived in in the the saddle saddle and and upon upon neighbor
nothing and and even even comrade too too often often means means one one who who is is no no longer longer

the the exception exception of of the the of of which which he he now now is is a a
naturalized naturalized citizen the the general general has has for for nearly nearly every every country country in in
the the world but but if if any any of of those those for for which which he he lost lost his his health health and and blood
and and for for which which he he his his life him it it makes makes no no sign
the the general general is is too too proud proud to to ask ask to to be be remembered there there is is no no
more more interesting interesting figure figure than than this this man man who who in in years years is is still still young young enough enough
to to lead lead an an army army corps and and who for for forty forty years has has been been selling selling his his

the the general general may may again again be be winning winning fresh fresh victories victories and and honors

so this this brief brief sketch sketch of of him him is is left left unfinished will will mark mark
be be continued






is is an an attempt attempt to to tell tell the the story story of of the the
the the man man who who was was born born after after his his time

the the reader knowing knowing something something of of the the strange strange career career of of
wonders wonders why why one one of of him him appreciatively appreciatively rather rather than than in in amusement
he he is is asked asked not not to to judge judge as as one one judges judges a a contemporary

in in our our day was was as as incongruous incongruous a a figure figure as as was was the the
at at the the of of he he was was as as unhappily unhappily out out of of the the
picture picture as as would would be be de de on on the the floor floor of of the the
of of as as at at the the time time he he was was judged by by of of comic comic
by by presidents presidents of of by by amateur amateur at at
was was a a joke the the vacant vacant mind mind of of the the village village
idiot returning returning to to also also was was a a joke
people people of of our our day day had had not not the the time time to to understand understand they they
thought thought him him a a charlatan half half a a dangerous dangerous adventurer adventurer and and half half a a fool
and and certainly certainly did did not not under under stand stand them last last words
addressed addressed to to his his wife this were would would rather rather die die a a
gentleman gentleman than than live live a a blackguard blackguard like like your your father

a a matter matter of of fact his his although although living living under under the the
disadvantage disadvantage of of being being a a magnate neither neither was nor nor is a a
blackguard and and his his son-in-law had had been been treated treated by by him him
and and with with patience for for the the and and soldier soldier of of fortune fortune it it was was
impossible impossible to to sympathize sympathize with with a a man man who who no no greater greater risk risk in in life life
than than to to ride ride on on one one of of his his own own and and of of the the views views the the two two men men
held held of of each each other that that of of was was probably probably the the and and
the the more more kindly

was was one one of of the the most most picturesque gallant and and pathetic pathetic
of of our our day but but also also our our sympathy

thrust thrust upon upon him him as as a a son-in-law must must be be trying

the the of of of of the the
was was born born on on to to the the date date all all
agree as as to to where where the the important important event event place place they they
differ he he was was born born in in his his friends friends are are positive but but at at the the
time time of of his his death death in in the the papers papers him him as as a a
native native of of agree agree that that his his ancestors ancestors were were and and
who who left left with with the the when when they they sought sought refuge refuge in in
version version which which seems seems to to be be the the most most probable probable is is that that he he was was
born born in in where where as as one one of of the the early early his his father
was was well well known and and that that early early in in his his life in in order order to to
educate educate him the the mother mother him him to to

irrevocable

discovered discovered that that the the house house into into the the garden garden of of which which he he had had so so
unceremoniously unceremoniously introduced introduced himself himself was was brilliantly brilliantly lighted and and that that the the
owner owner was was giving giving a a party one one time time two two of of the the guests guests walked walked into into the the
garden garden and and stood smoking smoking and and in in the the path path within within a a few few

the the bushes until until from from the the other other side side of of the the wall wall he he heard heard the the of of
his his friend friend and and of of another another officer

all all up his his friend friend whispered tentatively
two two nearer confuse confuse the the should should they they be be

phrases while while the the other in in a a low low and and distinct distinct voice said
cannot cannot get get out sentry sentry all all up you you get get back back
again

go go back back was was impossible now now felt felt that that in in any any case case he he was was
sure sure to to be be and and decided decided he he would as as he he it at at
least least have have a a run run for for his his money

the the him him by by sight but but did did not not turn turn
his his head and and whether whether the the sentry sentry recognized recognized him him or or not he he could could not not
tell

a a hundred hundred feet feet he he walked walked as as though though on on ice inwardly inwardly shrinking shrinking as as he he
for for the the sharp sharp challenge and and the the rattle rattle of of the the thrown thrown to to
the the nerves nerves were were leaping his his heart heart in in his his throat his his spine spine
of of water then as as he he continued continued to to advance and and still still no no tumult tumult
pursued pursued him he he his his pace pace and and turned turned into into one one of of the the main main
streets streets of of were were crowded crowded with with but but no no
one one noticed noticed him was was due due probably probably to to the the fact fact that that the the
no no distinctive distinctive uniform and and that that with with them them in in their their were were many many
who who khaki khaki riding riding breeches and and many many

openness openness of of his his saved saved him him from from suspicion

through through the the town town he he walked walked until until he he the the suburbs the the
open open veldt and and a a railroad railroad track he he had had no no map map or or compass compass he he
this this must must be be his his only only guide but but he he also also that that two two left left
the the one one along along which which he he had had been been to to
and and the the other the the one one leading leading to to the the coast coast and and freedom of of the the
two two this this one one was was he he had had no no idea but but he he his his chance and and a a hundred hundred

train train continued continued steadily steadily toward toward the the east and and so so told told him him that that it it was was
the the one one he he wanted and and that that he he was was on on his his way way to to the the neutral neutral territory territory
of of

the the daylight just just before before the the sun sun rose as as the the train train was was pulling pulling

a a little little thing thing like like a a war war between between friends

his his tour except except of of and and he he saw saw
very very little little of of this this country country or or of of its its people and and they they saw saw very very little little
of of him the the trip which which about about two two months he he cleared cleared ten ten
thousand thousand to to a a young young man man almost almost entirely entirely dependent dependent for for an an
income income upon upon his his newspaper newspaper work work and and the the sale sale of of his his books nearly nearly
him him for for the the two two months months of of one night night stands his his return return to to he he
his his seat seat in in the the new new

was was a a coincidence coincidence that that he he entered entered at at the the same same age age as as
did did his his father two two other other members one one born born six six days days earlier earlier than than
himself he he the the distinction distinction of of being being among among the the three three
members members of of the the new new

fact fact did did not not seem seem to to appall appall him the the it it is is a a tradition tradition that that
young young and and ambitious ambitious members members sit sit below the the gangway the the more more modest modest
and and less less assured assured are are content content to to place place themselves themselves above it at at a a point point
farthest farthest removed removed from from the the

the the day day he he was was sworn sworn in in there there was was much much curiosity curiosity to to see see where where
would would elect elect to to sit his his own own mind mind there there was was apparently apparently no no
doubt he he had had taken taken the the oath signed signed his his name and and shaken shaken the the hand hand
of of the the without without hesitation hesitation he he seated seated himself himself on on the the bench bench next next
to to the the minutes minutes later so so a a newspaper newspaper of of the the day day
it he he had had his his hat hat over over his his eyes his his hands hands into into his his
trousers trousers pockets and and was was lolling lolling back back the the of of the the
with with critical critical disapproval

maiden maiden speech speech was was delivered delivered in in in in reply reply to to
who who had had the the conduct conduct of of soldiers soldiers in in
defended defended them and and in in a a manner manner that that from from all all sides sides
him him honest honest admiration the the course course of of the the debate debate he he produced produced
and and read read a a strangely strangely apropos apropos letter letter which fifteen fifteen years years before had had
been been written written by by his his father father to to adroit adroit use use of of
this this filled filled the the editor editor of of the the with with
enthusiasm in in parliamentary parliamentary tactics he he declared since since
had had been been so so clever that that would would
be be the the leader said said he he never never before before
had had seen seen a a young young man by by means means of of his his maiden maiden effort spring spring into into the the
front front rank rank of of parliamentary parliamentary promised promised that that the the members members
would would ungrudgingly ungrudgingly testify testify to to his his ability ability and and honesty honesty of of purpose
others others to to at at once once recognize recognize the the rising rising star star was was himself himself
for for many many years years of of the the parliamentary parliamentary firmament firmament one one of of the the
stars he he wrote am am inclined inclined to to think think that that the the dash dash of of
blood blood which which he he has has from from his his mother mother has has been been an an improvement improvement on on
the the original original stock and and that that may may turn turn out out to to be be a a
stronger stronger and and politician politician than than his his father

was was all all a a part part of of luck that that when when he he entered entered
the the subject subject in in debate debate was was the the conduct conduct of of the the war

in in those those first first days days of of his his career career in in the the in in debates debates where where
angels angels to to tread he he did did not not hesitate hesitate to to rush rush in but but this this subject subject
was was one one on on which which he he spoke spoke with with knowledge the the older older men men who who were were
forced forced to to quote quote from from hearsay hearsay or or from from what what they they had had read had had
the the tremendous tremendous advantage advantage of of being being able able to to protest only only read read of of
that was was there saw saw it

the the he he became became at at once once one one of of the the conspicuous conspicuous and and picturesque picturesque
one one dear dear to to the the heart heart of of the the caricaturist and and one one from from the the
gallery gallery most most frequently frequently pointed pointed out was was called called the
spoiled spoiled child child of of the the and and there there were were several several distinguished distinguished
gentlemen gentlemen who who regretted regretted they they were were forced forced to to spare spare the the rod
the the for for was was one one of of these him him and and of of his his recruits recruits in in
spoke spoke with with the the awful awful frankness frankness of of the the enfant
terrible although although he he addressed addressed them them more more with with sorrow sorrow than than with with
anger to to and and he he daily daily advice advice and and
reproof while while mere mere and and like like and and
blushing blushing under under new new were were held held up up for for public public reproof reproof and and
briefly briefly but but severely severely chastened when when he he saw saw going going
astray did did he he hesitate hesitate in in his his duty duty to to the the country but but the the
by by the the hand hand and and gently gently instructed instructed him him in in the the way way he he should should go

did did not not tend tend to to make make him him popular but but in in spite spite of of his his unpopularity
in in his his against against national national he he made made so so good good a a fight fight
that that he he forced forced the the unwillingly to to appoint appoint a a committee committee to to
investigate investigate the the need need of of economy a a beginner beginner this this was was a a distinct distinct
triumph

and and other other clever clever young young
men he he formed formed inside inside the the a a little little group group that that in in its its
obstructive obstructive and and independent independent was was not not unlike unlike the the of of
his his father its its leader leader and and its its filibustering tactics tactics
the the men men who who composed composed it it were were the the

to to dictate dictate the the policy policy of of the the as as have have any any reactionary reactionary
the the already already recognized recognized
as as one one working working outside outside the the before before the the
vacation vacation of of that that year when when he he rose rose to to speak speak a a remarkable remarkable demonstration demonstration
was was made made against against him him by by his his all all of of them them rising rising and and
leaving leaving the the

the the who who to to hear hear him him he he stated stated that that if if to to his his
his his opinions opinions were were obnoxious he he was was ready ready to to resign resign his his
seat then then was was evident evident he he would would go go over over to to the the
thought thought he he which which way way the the tidal tidal wave wave was was coming and and to to being being
down down on on the the beach beach and and buried buried in in the the sand he he to to be be
swept swept forward forward on on its its crest believed believed he he left left the the
because because he he could could not not honestly honestly stomach stomach the the food food offered offered by by


any any event if if he he were were to to be be for for changing changing from from one one party party to to
the the other he he was was only only following following the the distinguished distinguished example example set set him him by by
and and his his own own father

was was at at the the time time of of this this change change that that he he was was called called the best best hated hated
man man in in but but the the welcomed welcomed him him gladly and and the the
paid paid him him the the rare rare compliment compliment of of giving giving in in his his honor honor a a
banquet were were present present two two hundred hundred members to to that that time time this this
dinner dinner was was the the most most marked marked testimony testimony to to his his importance importance in in the the political political
world was was about about then a a year year since that that he he
nine nine months months there there will will come come such such a a tide tide and and deluge deluge as as will will sweep sweep through through
and and and and completely completely wash wash out out and and effect effect a a
spring spring cleaning cleaning in in

the the deluge deluge came at at was was defeated and and
was was victorious and and when when the the new new was was formed formed the the
tidal tidal wave wave landed landed in in the the office office of of for for the the


this this is is being being written written the the papers papers say say that that within within a a
month month he he again again will will be be this this young young man man of of thirty thirty the the only only
promotion promotion remaining remaining is is a a position position in in the the in in which which august august body body
men men of of fifty fifty are are considered considered young

is is a a picturesque picturesque career any any man man of of his his few few years years speaking speaking our our
language his his career career is is probably probably the the most most picturesque that that he he is is

almost almost perfect his his brief brief career career one one must must remember remember that that the the
spring spring of of all all his his acts acts was was this this dream dream of of an an empire empire where where slavery slavery would would
be be recognized mother mother was was a a slaveholder he he had had been been

in in reading reading history history it it would would appear appear as as though though for for success success the the
first first requisite requisite must must be be an an utter utter lack lack of of humor and and inability inability to to look look
upon upon what what one one is is except except with with absolute absolute seriousness forty forty

a a smile smile that that two two his his army army moral and and material material
strength it it is is most most characteristic characteristic of of the the man man that that at at the the
moment moment he he was was rejoicing rejoicing over over this this addition addition to to his his forces to to maintain maintain
discipline discipline two two who who had had set set fire fire to to the the of of the the enemy enemy
he he ordered ordered to to be be shot weaker weaker man man would would have have the the two two

that that their their crimes crimes would would not not be be charged charged against against him the the success success of of
lay lay greatly greatly in in his his stern stern discipline tried tried the the men and and they they
to to their their guilt away and as as it it might might appear appear that that

mercy one one how how severe severe was was in in his his and and
how how frequently frequently the the death death penalty penalty was was by by him him against against his his own own
few few followers the the wonder wonder that that these these men as as independent independent and and as as
unaccustomed unaccustomed to to restraint restraint as as were were those those who who first first joined joined him
to to his his leadership can can explain explain it it only only by by the the personal personal quality quality of of
himself

these these fearless fearless who their their allies
believed believed and and proved proved that that with with his his rifle rifle one one could could account account for for a a
dozen dozen was was the the one one man man who who did did not not boast boast or or drink drink or or
gamble who who did did not not even even swear who who never never at at a a woman and and who in in
money money matters was was scrupulously scrupulously honest honest and and a a fight
his his followers followers that that for for them them he he would would risk risk being being shot shot just just as as
unconcernedly unconcernedly as as to to maintain maintain his his authority authority he he would would shoot shoot one one of of them

cowardice looting any any indignity indignity to to he he punished punished with with
death but but to to the the wounded either either of of his his own own or or of of the the enemys forces
he he was was as as gentle gentle as as a a nursing nursing sister sister and and the the brave brave and and able able he he
with with instant instant promotion promotion and and higher higher pay no no one one trait trait was was he he a a
demagogue can can find find no no effort effort on on his his part part to to ingratiate ingratiate himself himself with with
his his men the the of of his his staff staff there there were were no no
alone and and at at all all times times kept kept to to himself spoke spoke little and and
then then with with utter utter lack lack of of the the face face of of injustice
perjury or or physical physical danger he he was was always always calm firm dispassionate
it it is is said said that that on on those those infrequent infrequent occasions occasions when when his his anger anger
asserted asserted itself the the steady steady eyes eyes so so menacingly menacingly that that
those those who who faced faced them them would would as as soon soon look look down down the the barrel barrel of of his his

impression impression one one gets gets of of him him gathered gathered from from his his recorded recorded acts from from his his
own own writings from from the the writings writings of of those those who who with with him is is of of a a
silent young young man man believing believing religiously religiously in in his his star of of
destiny but in in all all matters matters that that did did not not concern concern himself possessed possessed of of
a a grim grim sense sense of of fun of of his his men men that that in in his his history history of of the the
war war he he records show show a a distinct distinct appreciation appreciation of of the the school school of of
humor for for instance when when he he how how he he wished wished to to make make one one of of them them
a a drummer drummer boy boy and and the the thanks colonel never never
seen seen a a picture picture of of a a battle battle yet yet that that the the first first thing thing in in it it wasn't a a dead dead

the the child child of of was was ten ten years years old old an an accident accident brought brought him him to to
the the knowledge knowledge of of the the king and and restored restored him him to to his his birthright day day
he he was was playing playing with with the the children children of of his his and and in in a a certain certain

though though pretended pretended to to make make light light of of it yet yet it it was was only only that that by by
keeping keeping fair fair with with the the king king he he might might bide bide his his time and and repay repay cruelty cruelty
with with cruelty

now as as in in our our story story has has grown grown to to mans estate and and is is ready ready
to to show show the the world world of of what what stuff stuff he he is is made it it will will be be well well to to explain explain
in in a a few few words what what was was the the state state of of things things in in that that part part of of the the
world world where where he he was was to to play play his his part

mighty mighty of of in in its its greatest greatest estate estate had had stretched stretched
from from the the on on the the east to to the the on on the the west when when
the the capital capital and and chief chief city city of of the the empire had had been been destroyed destroyed
by by the the subject subject people people living living on on the the northeastern borders borders of of
the the kingdom but but who who had had risen risen in in rebellion rebellion against against their their
was was broken broken in in pieces and and several several minor minor rose rose
on on her her ruins

these these the the chief chief were were and and in in the the east and and in in
the the west rose rose to to a a great great height height of of power power and and splendor splendor under under
as as we we have have seen seen in in our our sketch sketch of of that that kings life
a a brave brave and and warlike warlike people never never attained attained to to so so high high a a degree degree
of of civilization civilization as as the the nor nor did did they they ever ever have have a a monarch monarch
whose whose fame fame that that of of the the of of of of
or or of of of of but but under under a a succession succession
of of astute astute and and hardy hardy who who held held the the throne throne for for something something over over
one one hundred hundred and and fifty fifty years their their dominion dominion was was gradually gradually extended extended
until until it it stretched stretched from from the the to to the the centre centre of of
greatest greatest achievement achievement had had been been the the destruction destruction of of in in

the the remaining remaining province touched touched the the kingdom kingdom on on the the east
and and on on the the west west was was only only separated in in the the beginning from from the the

ruled ruled by by his his accept accept the the legendary legendary history history as as
it it has has come come down down to to us the the greatest greatest of of the the three three was was
governed governed by by while while was was ruled ruled by by a a
monarch monarch wise wise above above his his peers whose whose name name has has long long been been a a synonym synonym for for
unbounded unbounded wealth and and whose whose story though though not not beyond beyond the the bounds bounds of of
credibility more more like like a a fable fable of of romance romance than than a a tale tale of of sober sober
fact

was was the the brother-in-law of of and and in in close close alliance alliance not not
only only with with the the but but with with the the the the and and the the
and and he he was was at at the the height height of of his his power power and and was was looking looking forward forward
to to still still greater greater increase increase of of his his when when in in an an evil evil hour hour he he
struck struck against against the the growing growing greatness greatness of of and and was was crushed crushed in in the the
encounter he he been been less less arrogant the the doom doom he he wrought wrought for for himself himself
might might have have been been delayed but but it it could could not not have have been been wholly wholly
could could have have long long the the greed greed of of for for universal universal
dominion

have have seen seen what what good good cause cause had had to to hate hate he he
nursed nursed his his revenge revenge with with crafty crafty wisdom and and knowing knowing himself himself powerless powerless
to to act act openly openly and and alone he he tried tried what what stratagem stratagem might might do do to to bring bring
about about his his aim which which was was no no less less than than the the overthrow overthrow of of by by
means means of of the the grandson did did not not take take open open measures measures
until until he he he he had had allies allies enough enough at at his his back and and could could strike strike with with
a a sure sure aim worked worked with with the the great great in in private
stirring stirring them them up up against against by by of of all all sorts to to their their
ambition their their greed their their discontent their their private private wrongs and and
when when he he had had the the consent consent of of enough enough to to his his he he
called called upon upon as as one one who who had had chiefly chiefly from from the the tyranny tyranny
and and cruelty cruelty of of the the king to to lead lead the the proposed proposed revolt revolt in in person
that that had had been been gradually gradually strengthening strengthening his his own own kingdom kingdom of of
in in preparation preparation for for the the ambitious ambitious of of conquest conquest he he was was
nursing but but there there was was danger danger in in correspondence correspondence with with one one who who stood stood to to
in in the the double double relation relation of of a a and and hated hated grandson and and

proconsular proconsular power which which was was prolonged prolonged to to him him for for several several
years years

extraordinary extraordinary power power which which young young over over his his

believed believed to to be be a a favorite favorite of of the the gods since since he he had had risen risen to to
manhood he he every every morning morning into into the the where where he he spent spent some some
hours hours in in solitude solitude and and meditation all all he he did did was was considered considered by by

generosity generosity with with which which treated treated the the over over
a a great great number number of of of of those those tribes tribes who who declared declared
themselves themselves allies allies of of the the were were sent sent home home without without ransom is is
also also related related that that a a very very beautiful beautiful maiden maiden having having fallen fallen to to his his special special

offered offered to to become become the the allies allies of of the the or or to to recognize recognize their their
supremacy

is is said said not not to to have have set set out out against against until until the the year year
following but but it it can can scarcely scarcely be be conceived conceived why why the the
should should have have been been so so long long inactive and and it it is is a a probable probable supposition supposition
that that the the battle battle with with which which and and assign assign to to the the
year year was was very very soon soon after after the the taking taking of of
this this battle battle a a great great victory were were
slain and and with with their their camp fell fell into into the the hands hands of of the the victor
of of the the now now wished wished to to proclaim proclaim their their king but but he he
refused refused the the honor

fled fled with with the the remainder remainder of of his his army army toward toward the the and and the the
did did not not follow follow him partly partly because because he he thought thought his his
enemy enemy too too much much weakened weakened to to be be dangerous and and partly partly because because he he
lest lest he he might might expose expose himself himself to to the the combined combined of of the the two two other other
and and son son of of
the the defeated defeated general however had had carried carried considerable considerable wealth wealth
with with him him in in his his flight and and with with these these means means he he raised raised an an army army in in

this this general general had had retired retired to to the the south south of of and and had had distributed distributed
his his army army in in the the places places on on the the as as far far as as

for for no no one one had had ever ever at at before before he he had had held held the the
consulship the the year year was was made made consul consul with with
who who was was at at the the same same time time and and was was
consequently consequently not not allowed allowed to to leave leave therefore a a war war was was to to
be be carried carried on on abroad the the command command necessarily necessarily upon upon
wish wish was was immediately immediately to to sail sail with with an an army army to to but but the the more more
cautious cautious senators and and especially especially were were decidedly decidedly opposed opposed to to
his his plan partly partly because because as as long long as as he he was was in in
too too formidable formidable to to be be neglected and and partly partly because because they they were were
by by jealousy

that that could could obtain obtain was was that that should should be be assigned assigned to to him him
as as his his province with with thirty thirty and and with with permission permission to to sail sail over over
to to in in case case he he should should think think it it advantageous advantageous to to the the republic
he he did did not not obtain obtain from from the the permission permission to to levy levy an an army and and he he
therefore therefore called called upon upon the the allies allies to to provide provide him him with with troops troops
and and other other things things necessary necessary for for carrying carrying on on the the war they they were were all all
willing willing to to support support the the conqueror conqueror of of the the in in he he was was
soon soon to to sail sail to to with with nearly nearly seven seven thousand thousand volunteers volunteers
and and thirty thirty after after his his arrival arrival in in he he sent sent his his friend friend
with with a a part part of of his his fleet fleet to to partly partly to to keep keep up up the the
connection connection which which he he had had formed formed there on on his his visit visit from from with with
and and for to to the the latter latter had had sent sent back back a a nephew nephew
who who had had been been taken taken prisoner prisoner in in the the battle battle of of and and partly partly to to
show show to to his his timid timid at at how how groundless groundless their their fears fears were

again again joined joined the the of of at at at at last last

had had left left his his legate as as commander commander of of the the garrison garrison
in in that that place legate legate treated treated the the with with such such severity severity and and
cruelty cruelty that that they they sent sent an an embassy embassy to to to to lay lay their their
before before the the although although acquainted acquainted with with the the conduct conduct of of
had had nevertheless nevertheless left left him him in in command his his
him him on on this this and and other other grounds and and even even proposed proposed that that
he he should should be be commission commission was was sent sent out out to to inquire inquire into into the the
state state of of affairs affairs and and to to bring bring home if if the the against against him him
were were found found true proved proved that that his his army army was was in in the the best best possible possible
condition and and the the were were so so surprised surprised at at what what they they saw
that that instead instead of of the the consul they they bade bade him him sail sail to to as as
soon soon as as he he might might think think it it proper and and to to adopt adopt any any measures measures that that he he
might might think think useful

in in consequence consequence of of this in in as as proconsul with with
a a large large army from from to to and and landed landed in in the the neighborhood neighborhood
of of he he made made successful successful into into the the neighboring neighboring
country and and who who attempted attempted to to prevent prevent them a a
great great defeat could could not not gain gain possession possession of of which which was was
of of the the greater greater importance importance to to him him and and his his fleet fleet as as the the winter winter was was

been been engaged engaged to to him but but had had been been given given to to for for political political
reasons fearing fearing the the influence influence she she might might have have on on

a a degree degree that that they they thought thought it it necessary necessary to to recall recall from from

proposed proposed would would have have the the war war in in a a manner manner honorable honorable to to the the
however whose whose only only object object was was to to gain gain
time made made no no to to the the conditions but but only only a a truce truce
of of forty-five days during during which which an an embassy embassy was was to to be be sent sent to to
this this truce truce was was at at an an end the the populace populace

who who wished wished to to bring bring the the war war to to a a conclusion and and was was unwilling unwilling
to to share share the the glory glory with with else determined determined to to bring bring to to a a
decisive decisive battle at at first first an an engagement but but
when when in in order order to to deceive deceive the the enemy hastily hastily retreated retreated as as if if he he

difficulties difficulties that that he he to to negotiate negotiate with with for for peace
conditions however which which now now proposed proposed were were so so humiliating
that that the the would would not not accept accept them therefore
though though he he saw saw the the impossibility impossibility of of gaining gaining any any further further was was
compelled compelled to to decide decide the the affair affair by by a a last last and and desperate desperate effort a a
personal personal interview interview between between the the two two was was inexorable inexorable as as
to to the the conditions army army was was in in a a bad bad condition and and in in the the
ensuing ensuing battle to to the the west west of of the the victory victory of of was was

he he had had already already been been honored honored in in and and which which was was upon upon
him him for for the the third third time time in in during during one one of of the the
disputes disputes between between the the and and was was sent sent
with with two two other other to to mediate mediate between between the the but but
nothing nothing was was settled though as as might might easily easily
have have put put an an end end to to the the disputes was was the the only only who who thought thought
it it unworthy unworthy of of the the republic republic to to support support those those who who
and and there there was was a a tradition tradition that that in in

his his exile who who in in the the conversation conversation which which place declared declared
the the greatest greatest of of all all the the story story of of the the conversation conversation be be
true true or or not the the judgment judgment to to is is just for for as as
a a general general was was second second to to none none but but himself

the the year year some some arose arose in in the the as as to to what what
should should be be assigned assigned to to the the two two and and
brother brother of of the the great great although although
he he was was princeps princeps senatus offered offered to to accompany accompany his his brother as as legate
if if the the would would give give him him as as his his province for for this this province province
upon upon the the command command in in the the war war against against

thence thence for for his his son son with with him him on on this this expedition
but but by by some some unlucky unlucky chance chance the the boy boy was was taken taken prisoner and and sent sent to to
king king offered offered to to restore restore him him to to freedom and and to to give give a a
considerable considerable sum sum of of money if if the the father father would would interpose interpose his his influence influence
to to obtain obtain favorable favorable terms terms for for the the king refused but but the the
king notwithstanding soon soon after after sent sent the the boy boy back back to to his his father who who
just just then then was was suffering suffering from from illness and and was was absent absent from from the the camp
show show his his gratitude sent sent a a message message to to
him him not not to to engage engage in in a a battle battle until until he he himself himself had had to to the the
camp the the great great battle battle near near again again
applied applied to to for for peace and and the the latter latter now now used used his his influence influence
with with his his brother brother and and the the council council of of war on on behalf behalf of of the the king
conditions conditions of of the the peace peace were were tolerably tolerably mild but but they they were were
made made much much more more severe severe when when the the peace peace was was ratified ratified at at

his his brother brother were were by by the the hostile hostile party party as as the the result result
of of from from and and of of the the liberation liberation of of the the son son of of
charge charge was was therefore therefore brought brought against against the the two two on on
their their return return to to of of having having accepted accepted of of the the king and and of of
having having retained retained a a part part of of the the treasures treasures which which they they ought ought to to have have
delivered delivered up up to to the the the the same same time time they they were were called called upon upon to to
give give an an account account of of the the of of money money they they had had taken taken from from
was was ready ready to to obey but but his his brother brother with with indignation indignation
the the accounts accounts from from the the hands hands of of his his brother brother and and them them to to
pieces pieces before before the the tribune tribune of of the the people
however fined fined and and when when he he was was going going to to be be thrown thrown
into into prison prison until until he he should should pay pay the the heavy heavy fine him him
away and and the the tribune tribune though though disapproving disapproving of of the the
violence violence of of liberated liberated from from imprisonment
himself himself was was now now before before the the people people by by the the tribune tribune
but but instead instead of of answering answering the the he he the the people people that that it it
was was the the anniversary anniversary of of his his victory victory at at and and bade bade them them rather rather thank thank
the the gods gods for for such such as as he

these these troubles troubles he he to to his his villa villa near near and and it it
was was owing owing to to the the interposition interposition of of that that he he was was not not
compelled compelled to to obey obey another another summons of of his his brother brother
however were were but but the the sum sum produced produced by by their their
sale sale did did not not make make up up the the amount amount of of the the fine friends friends and and
not not only only offered offered to to make make up up the the sum but but their their generosity generosity would would even even
have have made made him him than than he he had had been been before but but he he refused refused to to accept accept
anything anything beyond beyond what what was was absolutely absolutely necessary necessary for for his his support
never never from from his his voluntary voluntary exile and and he he spent spent the the
last last years years of of his his life life in in quiet quiet retirement retirement at at his his villa is is said said to to
have have wished wished to to be be buried buried on on his his estate but but there there was as as a a
tradition tradition that that he he at at and and was was buried buried in in the the tomb tomb of of his his
family family near near the the where where of of him his his brother brother
and and their their friend friend were were erected year year of of his his
death death is is not not quite quite certain for according according to to he he in in the the
same same year year with with and and according according to to
others two two years years earlier earlier

judging judging of of as as a a general we we may may adopt adopt the the judgment judgment
to to but but as as a a citizen citizen he he is is very very far far from from
deserving deserving such such praise pride pride and and haughtiness haughtiness were were intolerable and and

that that they they and and the the whole whole island island was was restored restored to to the the

negotiations negotiations were were going going on crossed crossed over over to to the the
province which which was was threatened threatened by by the the of of

the the native native inhabitants inhabitants were were his his friends but but were were in in terror terror of of the the

however shut shut himself himself up up in in and and no no aid aid to to
and and had had made made up up his his mind mind to to raise raise the the siege siege and and attack attack
itself when when one one of of his his soldiers soldiers came came to to tell tell him him that that in in an an
aqueduct aqueduct which which had had been been stopped he he had had found found that that the the passage passage for for the the
water water could could easily easily be be enlarged enlarged so so as as to to admit admit armed armed men more more he he
the the native native but but the the inhabitants inhabitants would would not not submit
and and he he sent sent on on the the of of his his men with with two two trumpets trumpets and and with with
while while he he made made an an attack attack to to divert divert the the attention attention of of the the
way way was was long and and the the soldiers soldiers found found themselves themselves in in the the very very
heart heart of of in in a a basin basin with with very very steep steep sides impossible as as it it
to to climb man man however scrambled scrambled up up and and found found himself himself in in a a
hovel where where he he a a rope rope and and pulled pulled up up his his

by by the the but but whose whose name name was was probably probably to to the the
command army army suspected suspected treachery raised raised on on their their

in in thought thought it it better better to to draw draw off off to to to to reorganize reorganize
his his army so so the the way way to to was was left left open open to to who who had had only only
to to summon summon a a small small garrison garrison to to submit it it in in the the of of

when when the the of of a a protracted protracted siege siege came came on on them they they loudly loudly
though though all all the the useless useless mouths mouths were were safely safely sent sent off off by by sea sea

is is impossible impossible to to dwell dwell at at length length on on the the events events of of the the siege siege and and the the
gallant gallant deeds deeds on on either either side under under were were gallant gallant
but but the the of of the the reduced reduced their their numbers and and
finally late late in in the the of of broke broke up up his his camp camp and and

found found himself himself the the eldest eldest son son of of the the of of and and was was created created
by by his his father father of of of of and and of of
early early education education of of the the is is unknown but but it it may may be be
that that during during the the life life of of his his mother of of high high honor honor
and and virtue virtue had had been been into into his his bosom which which became became dormant
though though not not extinct as as rising rising toward toward manhood evil evil
advantage advantage of of idleness idleness and and indulgence indulgence to to call call into into action action the the passions passions
of of the the young young prince in in order order to to lead lead him him to to their their own own purposes

tales tales of of his his debauchery and and the the depravity depravity of of his his taste while while a a

but but the the positive positive of of older older whose whose means means
of of information information was was great great and and immediate must must always always be be more more valuable valuable
than than the the theoretical theoretical doubts doubts of of persons persons who who live live when when a a thousand thousand
sources sources of of knowledge knowledge have have been been buried buried under under the the lumber lumber of of ages is is
therefore therefore more more than than probable probable that in in his his youth the the
himself himself up up to to low low unworthy unworthy a a prince prince and and a a gentleman and and
to to his his passions passions which which were were forbidden forbidden by by his his
reason through through the the whole whole course course of of his his youthful youthful
as as by by those those least least favorable favorable in in their their account there there is is to to be be
seen seen the the forth forth of of those those better better that that nobler nobler soul
which which him him in in after after years years one one of of the the greatest greatest and and best best of of


of of a a multitude multitude of of events events which which might might be be brought brought forward forward to to prove prove
this this fact one one of of the the best best and and the the most most striking is is
his his submission submission to to it it would would appear had had
entered entered the the of of in in support support of of one one of of his his dissolute dissolute
who who had had himself himself amenable amenable to to the the laws laws of of his his
country the the presence presence and and influence influence of of the the prince the the
magistrate magistrate did did his his duty duty toward toward the the offender without without fear fear or or favor
and and in in the the heat heat of of the the moment struck struck the the judge judge upon upon the the
unmoved unmoved and and unruffled the the without without
a a hesitation hesitation on on the the score score of of the the rank rank or or power at at once once
committed committed him him for for contempt contempt of of court

had had been been given given for for the the better better spirit spirit to to assume assume her her influence and and
struck struck with with the the conscientious conscientious courage courage of of the the judge the the heirapparent
of of the the throne throne to to the the punishment punishment he he had had merited and and
himself himself without without opposition opposition to to be be led led to to prison thus thus setting setting
a a noble noble example example of of obedience obedience to to the the laws father father was was of of a a mind mind
well well qualified qualified to to appreciate appreciate the the conduct conduct both both of of his his son son and and of of his his
sons judge and and when when the the news news was was brought brought by by those those who who
sought sought to to inflame inflame the the mind mind against against the the of of his his
with with joy is is the the king king whose whose
possess possess courage courage to to execute execute the the laws laws upon upon such such an an offender and and still still
more more happy happy is is he he who who has has for for a a son son a a prince prince willing willing to to endure endure such such
wholesome wholesome chastisement

from from all all accounts accounts it it would would appear appear that that many many parts parts of of the the
conduct conduct great great pain pain and and to to his his father yet yet we we
find find that that never never to to entrust entrust to to his his care care some some of of the the
greatest greatest and and most most important important military military operations operations of of his his reign
the the prince prince had had already already the the qualities qualities of of a a soldier in in a a
degree degree sufficient sufficient to to attract attract the the notice notice of of his his father or or whether whether the the
king king sought sought only only to to habituate habituate him him early early to to that that inevitable inevitable career career of of
arms arms which which was was in in those those days days one one of of the the of of royalty we we are are
not not informed but but so so early early as as his his sixteenth sixteenth or or seventeenth seventeenth year year he he
at at the the battle battle of of in in which which was was slain
was was the the part part assigned assigned to to the the prince prince on on this this occasion occasion do do not not
find find stated stated precisely but but all all accounts accounts agree agree that that he he proved proved of of
infinite infinite assistance assistance and and service service to to his his father and and long long in in the the
of of the the battle after after having having been been severely severely wounded wounded by by an an arrow arrow

death death of of spread spread dismay dismay among among his his soldiers soldiers and and allies and and
after after a a fight fight of of nearly nearly four four hours hours the the party party of of fled
leaving leaving the the king king master master of of the the field field of of battle and and a a number number of of noble noble
of of these these were were executed executed either either at at or or

current current among among the the of of the the period on on which which has has
founded founded one one of of the the most most beautiful beautiful scenes scenes in in his his historical historical
poet however is is far far more more indebted indebted for for the the splendor splendor of of his his materials materials
to to his his own own imagination than than any any historical historical record facts as as
related related by by the the best best authorities are are simply simply as as follows

the the first first attack attack of of apoplexy apoplexy the the king king was was carried carried to to a a chamber chamber
in in the the house house of of the the of of and and put put to to bed and and at at his his
own own desire desire the the crown crown was was laid laid upon upon his his pillow in in a a
state state of of great great weakness weakness for for some some time and and at at length after after a a second second
attack to to those those who who were were him him to to have have the the
spirit chamberlain chamberlain immediately immediately spread spread a a linen linen cloth cloth over over the the face face
of of the the king and and to to communicate communicate his his supposed supposed death death to to the the
heirapparent who entering entering the the room room to to take take a a last last look look at at his his
fathers body removed removed the the crown crown from from his his pillow and and carried carried it it into into
another another apartment a a short short time time the the monarch monarch revived and and sending sending
for for his his son son angrily why why he he had had removed removed the the crown

long long after after this this conversation conversation expired and and his his son the the

deserted deserted by by all he he had had to to make make his his way way from from one one place place of of concealment concealment
to to another another till till after after some some wandering wandering he he in in
bad bad news news had had him and and in in consequence consequence everything everything was was in in
confusion arose arose that that difficult difficult question should should be be the the new new

youth youth was was gone gone and and his his work work was was done therefore therefore his his prayers prayers and and
were were treated treated with with cold cold neglect nearly nearly four four years years he he
pressed pressed his his suit suit and and in in we we find find him him writing writing a a letter letter
to to the the emperor emperor begging begging him him to to direct direct the the of of the the to to come come
to to a a decision decision upon upon it letter letter in in which which pathetically pathetically enough he he
speaks speaks of of himself himself as as old and and poor poor and and indebted produced produced no no result result

a a white white man man reaching reaching the the cave cave and and returning the the chances chances were were a a
hundred hundred to to one and and the the difficulties difficulties of of the the journey journey are are illustrated illustrated by by
the the fact fact that that and and were were unable unable to to move move than than at at
the the rate rate of of a a mile mile an an hour making making the the last last mile mile they they consumed consumed three three
hours they they the the base base of of the the kopje kopje in in which which was was

motionless motionless as as the the granite granite around around or or and and over over
loose loose stones stones which which a a miss miss of of hand hand or or knee knee would would have have and and sent sent
clattering clattering into into the the village an an hour hour of of this this tortuous tortuous climbing climbing
the the cave cave suddenly suddenly opened opened before before them and and they they
recognized recognized that that to to take take him him alive alive from from his his stronghold stronghold was was an an
impossibility and and that that even even they they themselves themselves would would leave leave the the place place was was
equally equally doubtful orders he he killing killing the the man man who who had had

concealment concealment being being no no longer longer possible the the white white men men rose rose to to fly fly a a great great
shout shout of of anger anger told told them them they they were were discovered the the same same moment moment two two
returning returning from from a a stream stream where where they they had had gone gone for for water saw saw the the
and and screaming screaming to to give give the the alarm race race that that
two two hours for for so so quickly quickly did did the the spread spread out out on on every every
side side that that it it was was impossible impossible for for to to gain gain ground ground in in any any one one
direction and and he he was was forced forced to to dodge turn and and double one one time time
the the white white men men were were driven driven back back to to the the very very kopje kopje from from which which the the race race had had

exploit exploit was was one one of of the the chief chief in in bringing bringing the the war war
to to a a close finding finding their their leader leader was was only only a a mortal mortal like like
themselves and and so so could could not as as he he had had promised bring bring to to
their their aid lost lost heart and and when when in in person person made made of of
peace his his terms terms were were accepted the the hard hard days days of of the the siege when when
rations rations were were few few and and bad little little girl who who had had been been the the first first
white white child child born born in in of of fever fever and and lack lack of of proper proper
food with with other other causes causes led led him him to to leave leave and and return return to to
is is possible possible he he then then thought thought he he had had forever forever turned turned
his his back back on on but though though he he himself himself had had departed the the
impression impression he he had had made made there there behind behind him

did did not not rest rest long long in in the the hunt hunt for for gold gold had had
just just begun and the the old old restlessness restlessness seizing seizing him he he left left and and
her her blue blue skies tropical tropical plants and and strikes strikes for for the the new new raw raw
land land of of the the it it has has always always been been the the place place that that is is
being being made not not the the place place in in being that that has has helped helped to to make make
straight straight the the ways ways of of several several great great
and and he he once once said is is the the constructive constructive
side side of of frontier frontier life life that that most most to to me the the building building up up of of a a
country where where you you see see the the persistent persistent drive drive and and force force of of the the white white man
when when the the place place is is finally finally settled settled don't dont seem seem to to enjoy enjoy it it very very long

he he did did much much and with with a a sled sled and and only only two two dogs
for for twenty-four twentyfour days days made made one one long long fight fight against against snow snow and and ice covering covering
six six hundred hundred mining mining in in he he well but but against against
the the country country he he holds holds a a constant constant grudge because because it it kept kept him him out out of of the the
fight fight with with war war was was declared declared he he was was in in the the and and
nothing nothing of of it and and though though on on his his return return to to civilization civilization he he
volunteering volunteering for for the the and and at at once once
south by by the the time time he he had had the the war war was was over

times times has has he he spoken spoken to to me me of of how how bitterly bitterly he he regretted regretted missing missing
this this chance chance to to officially officially fight fight for for his his country he he had had twice twice
served served with with forces forces made made him him the the more more keen keen to to show show his his loyalty loyalty to to
his his own own people

he he would would have have been been given given a a commission commission in in the the seems seems
evident evident from from the the opinion opinion has has publicly publicly expressed expressed of of
him

know know the the wrote wrote in in is is a a scout scout and and a a
hunter hunter of of courage courage and and ability a a man man totally totally without without fear a a sure sure shot
and and a a fighter is is the the ideal ideal scout and and when when in in the the military military
service service of of any any country country he he is is bound bound to to be be of of the the greatest greatest benefit

truth truth of of this this was was soon soon to to prove

he he had had to to the the and and in in of of had had been been
six six months months in in that that same same month month for for
to to take take command command of of the the army and and with with him him on on his his staff staff was was
former former commander now now
night night as as the the ship ship was was in in the the of of was was talking talking of of
and and giving giving of of his his powers powers as as a a tracker

is is the the best best scout scout we we ever ever had had in in declared

why why don't dont we we get get him him back back there said said

is is well well known

a a cable cable was was sent sent to to offering offering the the
position created created especially especially for for him of of chief chief of of of of the the
army army in in the the field

never never before before in in the the history history of of has has one one nation nation paid paid so so
pleasant pleasant a a tribute tribute to to the the abilities abilities of of a a man man of of another another nation

sequel sequel is is interesting by by the the steamer steamer
of of purser purser left left it it at at the the and and until until two two
hours hours and and a a half half before before the the steamer steamer was was listed listed to to start start on on her her return return
trip there there it it lay in in asking asking for for his his mail received received it
two two hours hours and and a a half half he he had had his his family himself and and his his belongings belongings
on on board board the the steamer and and had had on on his his
journey journey from from to to

paper paper of of published published the the day day after after
a a side side light light on on his his character telling telling of of his his hasty hasty
departure departure the the day day before and and of of the the high high compliment compliment that that had had been been paid paid
to to a prominent prominent it it has has lived lived in in
since since last last and and has has been been for for many many months he he has has
said said little little of of his his past and and few few have have known known that that he he is is the the man man famous famous
over over the the world world as as the scout of of the the

a a man man who who to to the the did did not for for reasons reasons best best known known to to
himself talk talk about about his his past it it is is characteristic characteristic of of that
though though he he lived lived there there two two years his his did did not not know until until the the
him him from from among among them that that he he had had not not always always
been been a a prospector prospector like like themselves

was was on on the the same same ship ship that that carried carried the the latter latter half half of of his his
journey from from to to and and every every night night for for seventeen seventeen
nights nights was was one one of of a a group group of of men men who who shot shot questions questions at at him it it was was
interesting interesting to to see see a a one one had had heard heard praised praised so so highly highly
so so completely completely make make good was was not not as as though though he he had had a a credulous credulous
audience audience of of commercial commercial the the who who each each evening evening
gathered gathered around around him him were were of of the the cavalry
commanding commanding the the of of
staff each each of of whom whom was was later later killed killed in in action
of of the the and and
of of these these had had either either held held command command in in border border
in in or or the the or or had had hunted hunted big big game and and the the questions questions
each each asked asked were were the the outcome outcome of of his his own own experience experience and and observation

for for a a single single evening evening could could a a faker faker have have to to the the midnight midnight
examination examination through through which which they they put put and and not not have have exposed exposed his his
ignorance wanted wanted to to know know what what difference difference there there is is in in a a column column of of
dust dust raised raised by by cavalry cavalry and and by by trek trek how how to to tell tell whether whether a a horse horse
that that has has passed passed was was going going at at a a trot trot or or a a gallop the the way way to to throw throw a a
diamond diamond hitch how how to to make make a a fire fire without without at at the the same same time time making making a a
target target of of yourself how

what what made made us us most most admire admire was was that that when when he he did did not not know know he he at at
once once said said so

two two nights nights he he had had us us so so absolutely absolutely at at his his mercy mercy that that we we would would
have have him him anywhere anything anything he he chose chose to to tell tell us we we would would have have
accepted were were ready ready to to believe believe in in flying flying flying flying
that that wild wild turkeys turkeys dance dance that that you you must must never never sleep sleep in in
the the moonlight he he you you believe believe in in we we would would
have have shouted shouted ask ask that that a a scout scout should should on on an an ocean ocean steamer steamer prove prove
his his ability ability was was certainly certainly him him under under a a severe severe handicap

one one of of the the said about about as as fair fair a a game game as as
though though we we planted planted the the captain captain of of this this ship ship in in the the and and
told told him him to to prove prove he he could could run run a a liner

all all love love that that are are known known to to human human history the the love love story story of of
and and has has been been for for nineteen nineteen the the most most
remarkable has has the the resources resources of of the the plastic plastic and and the the graphic graphic
arts has has been been made made the the theme theme of of poets poets and and of of prose prose
has has and and in in a a thousand thousand forms and and it it as as much much
to to the the imagination imagination today as as it it did did when when deserted deserted his his almost almost
victorious victorious troops troops and and in in a a swift swift galley galley from from in in pursuit pursuit
of of

wonder wonder of of the the story story is is by by its its extraordinary extraordinary nature
men men in in private private life life have have lost lost fortune fortune and and fame fame for for the the love love of of woman
have have the the odium odium of of their their people and and have have nothing nothing
for for it it in in comparison comparison with with the the joys joys of of sense sense that that come come from from the the
lingering lingering and and kisses such such as as
have have lost lost the the leadership leadership of of their their party party and and have have gone gone down down in in
history history with with a a clouded clouded name name because because of of the the fascination fascination upon upon
them them by by some some woman often often far far from from beautiful and and yet yet possessing possessing the the
mysterious mysterious power power which which makes makes the the of of statesmanship statesmanship seem seem slight slight
in in comparison comparison with with the the swiftly swiftly flying flying hours hours of of pleasure

in in the the case case of of and and alone alone do do we we find find a a man man
away away not not merely merely the the of of civic civic honors honors or or the the headship headship of of a a
state but but much much more more than than mastery mastery of of what what was was practically practically
the the answer answer to to the the of of a a will the the
story story of of the the triumvir triumvir and and the the queen queen is is not not like like any any
other other story story that that has has yet yet been been told sacrifice sacrifice involved involved in in it it was was so so
overwhelming so so instantaneous and and so so complete complete as as to to set set this this
narrative narrative above above all all others genius genius has has touched touched it it with with
the the glory glory of of a a great great imagination using using it it in in the the finest finest of of his his
plays expressed expressed its its nature nature in in the the title title for for

distinguished distinguished historian the the author author of of many many
books has has tried tried hard hard to to eliminate eliminate nearly nearly all all the the romantic romantic elements elements
from from the the tale and and to to have have us us see see in in it it not not the the triumph triumph of of love but but
the the blindness blindness of of ambition his his handling handling it it almost almost a a
sordid sordid drama drama of of mans pursuit pursuit of of power power and and of of selfishness
us us review review the the story story as as it it remains even even after after we we have have taken taken full full
account account of of criticism the the world world for for nineteen nineteen hundred hundred
years years been been blinded blinded by by a a show show of of sentiment it it so so absolutely absolutely been been
by by those those who who lived lived and and wrote wrote in in the the days days which which closely closely
on on the the events events that that make make up up this this extraordinary extraordinary narrative

successively successively captivated captivated two two of of the the greatest greatest men men whom whom had had ever ever
seen like like a a queen to to escape escape disgrace modern modern
may may have have to to say say concerning concerning small small details this this story story still still
remains remains the the love love story story of of which which the the world world has has any any record







a a woman amid amid the the of of passionate passionate and and languishing languishing love
has has out out in in a a sort sort of of ecstasy

love love you you as as no no woman woman ever ever loved loved a a man man before

she she this this she she it whole whole soul soul is is with with the the
ardor ardor of of emotion really really seems seems to to her her that that no no one one ever ever could could have have
loved loved so so much much as as she

untaught become become almost almost one one of of
those those of of amorous amorous expression expression which which belong belong to to the the
vocabulary vocabulary of of woman woman who who it when when torn torn by by
the the almost almost terrible terrible extravagance extravagance of of a a great great love that that no no one one
before before her her has has ever ever said said it and and that that in in her her own own case case it it is is absolutely absolutely
true

how how many many are are really really faithful faithful to to the the end many indeed
if if circumstances circumstances admit admit of of easy easy faithfulness highsouled generous
ardent ardent nature nature will will endure endure an an infinity infinity of of of of
misfortune of of neglect and and even even of of ill ill treatment so the the flame
though though it it may may sink sink low can can be be revived revived again again to to burn burn as as as as
before in in order order that that this this may may be be so so it it is is necessary necessary that that the the
object object of of such such a a wonderful wonderful devotion devotion be be alive that that he he be be present present and and
visible or if if he he be be absent that that there there should should still still exist exist some some hope hope
of of renewing renewing the the exquisite exquisite intimacy intimacy of of the the past

man man who who is is sincerely sincerely loved loved may may be be compelled compelled to to take take long long journeys journeys
which which will will separate separate him him for for an an indefinite indefinite time time from from the the woman woman who who has has
given given her her heart heart to to him and and she she will will still still be be constant may may be be
imprisoned perhaps perhaps for for life yet yet there there is is always always the the hope hope of of his his
release release or or of of his his escape and and some some will will be be faithful faithful to to him him and and
will will watch watch for for his his return given given a a situation situation which which absolutely absolutely bars bars
out out hope which which two two souls souls in in such such a a way way that that they they can can never never be be
united united in in this this world and and there there we we have have a a test test so so terribly terribly severe severe that that
few few even even of of the the most most loyal loyal and and intensely intensely lovers lovers can can endure endure it

that that such such a a situation situation would would lead lead a a woman woman to to turn turn to to any any other other man man
than than the the one one to to whom whom she she had had given given her her very very life but but we we might might expect expect
that that at at least least her her strong strong desire desire would would cool cool and and weaken might might
cherish cherish his his memory memory among among the the precious precious of of her her love love life but but
that that she she should should still still pour pour out out the the same same rapturous unstinted unstinted passion passion as as
before before seems seems almost almost too too much much to to believe annals annals of of emotion emotion record record
only only one one such such instance and and so so this this instance instance has has become become known known to to all
and and has has been been cherished cherished for for nearly nearly a a thousand thousand years the the
story story of of a a woman woman who who did did love perhaps as as no no one one ever ever loved loved before before or or
since for for she she was was subjected subjected to to this this cruel cruel test and and she she met met the the test test
not not alone alone completely but but triumphantly triumphantly and and almost almost fiercely

story story is of of course the the story story of of and and has has many many
times times been been falsely falsely told of of it it have have been been omitted and and other other
of of it it have have been been garbled whole whole literature literature has has grown grown up up
around around the the subject may may well well be be worth worth our our while while to to clear clear away away the the
and and the the doubtful doubtful points and and once once more more to to tell tell it it simply
without without bias and and with with a a strict strict adherence adherence to to what what seems seems to to be be the the truth truth
attested attested by by authentic authentic records

is is one one circumstance circumstance connected connected with with the the story story which which we we must must
specially specially note narrative narrative does does something something more more than than set set forth forth the the
one one quite quite unimpeachable unimpeachable instance instance of of unconquered unconquered constancy
how in in the the last last analysis that that which which touches touches the the human human heart heart has has more more
vitality vitality and and more more enduring enduring interest interest than than what what the the intellect intellect or or
those those of of the the human human mind mind which which are are external external to to our our
emotional emotional nature

reason reason as as against against blind blind faith the the years years of of his his wandering wandering he he
came came to to have have a a wide wide knowledge knowledge of of the the world world and and of of human human nature we we
try try to to imagine imagine him him as as he he was was in in his his year year we we shall shall find find in in
him him a a remarkable remarkable combination combination of of attractive attractive qualities

must must be be remembered remembered that that though in in a a sense he he was was an an ecclesiastic
he he had had not not yet yet been been ordained ordained to to the the priesthood but but was was rather rather a a
person person who who did did not not belong belong to to any any religious religious order though though he he
was was supposed supposed to to live live according according to to a a definite definite set set of of religious religious rules rules and and
as as a a member member of of a a religious religious community however made made rather rather
light light of of his his was was at at once once an an accomplished accomplished man man
of of the the world world and and a a profound profound scholar was was nothing nothing of of the the recluse recluse
about about him mingled mingled with with his his fellow fellow men whom whom he he dominated dominated by by the the
charm charm of of his his personality was was eloquent ardent and and persuasive
could could turn turn a a delicate delicate compliment compliment as as as as he he could could elaborate elaborate a a
syllogism rich rich voice voice had had in in it it a a seductive seductive quality quality which which was was never never
without without its its effect

and and well well formed he he possessed possessed as as much much vigor vigor of of body body as as of of
mind were were his his accomplishments accomplishments entirely entirely those those of of the the scholar
wrote wrote dainty dainty verses which which he he also also set set to to music and and which which he he sang sang
himself himself with with a a rare rare skill have have called called him him the first first of of the the
and and many many who who nothing nothing for for his his skill skill in in logic logic admired admired
him him for for his his gifts gifts as as a a musician musician and and a a poet he he was was one one to to
attract attract attention attention wherever wherever he he for for none none could could fail fail to to recognize recognize
his his power

was was soon soon after after his his year year that that he he to to
where where he he was was welcomed welcomed by by much much tact tact he he reconciled reconciled
himself himself to to his his so so that that his his life life now now to to be be full full of of
promise promise and and of of sunshine

was was at at this this time time that that he he became became acquainted acquainted with with a a very very beautiful beautiful
young young girl girl named named was was only only eighteen eighteen years years of of age yet yet
already already she she possessed possessed not not only only beauty but but many many accomplishments accomplishments which which
were were then then quite quite rare rare in in since since she she both both wrote wrote and and spoke spoke a a number number
of of languages and like like was was a a lover lover of of music music and and poetry
was was the the illegitimate illegitimate daughter daughter of of a a canon canon of of patrician patrician blood so so
that that she she is is said said to to have have been been a a worthy worthy representative representative of of the the noble noble
house house of of the the throughout throughout history history for for
chivalry chivalry and and charm

to to this this time time we we do do not not know know precisely precisely what what sort sort of of life life had had
lived lived in in private declared declared that that he he had had squandered squandered his his
substance substance in in vicious vicious ways friends friends denied denied this and and represented represented him him
as as strict strict and and chaste truth truth probably probably lies lies between between these these two two
was was naturally naturally a a man man of of the the world who who
may may very very possibly possibly have have relieved relieved his his studies studies by by occasional occasional
revelry revelry and and light light love is is not not at at all all likely likely that that he he was was addicted addicted to to
gross gross passions passions and and low low

such such as as he he was when when he he first first saw saw he he conceived conceived for for her her a a
violent violent attachment guarded guarded in in the the house house of of her her uncle
it it was was difficult difficult at at first first for for to to meet meet her her save save in in the the
most most casual casual way yet yet every every time time that that he he heard heard her her exquisite exquisite voice voice and and
watched watched her her graceful graceful manners manners he he became became more more and and more more infatuated
studies studies suddenly suddenly tame tame and and colorless colorless beside beside the the fierce fierce scarlet scarlet
flame flame which which blazed blazed up up in in his his heart

it it was was because because of of these these studies studies and and of of his his great great
reputation reputation as as a a scholar scholar that that he he managed managed to to obtain obtain access access to to
her her uncle uncle and and made made a a chance chance proposal proposal that that he he should should himself himself
become become an an inmate inmate of of household household in in order order that that he he might might teach teach
this this girl girl of of so so much much promise an an offer offer coming coming from from so so brilliant brilliant a a
man man was was accepted

that that time time could could visit visit without without restraint was was
her her teacher and and the the two two spent spent hours hours together nominally nominally in in the the study study
of of and and but but doubtless doubtless very very little little was was said said between between them them
upon upon such such unattractive unattractive the the contrary with with all all his his wide wide
experience experience of of life his his eloquence his his perfect perfect manners and and his his
fascination put put forth forth his his power power to to captivate captivate the the senses senses of of a a
girl girl still still in in her her teens teens and and quite quite ignorant ignorant of of the the world
he he employed employed to to win win her her the the genius genius which which had had overwhelmed overwhelmed all all the the
great great of of learning learning in in the the world

was was then then that that the the pleasures pleasures of of knowledge the the joys joys of of thought the the
of of eloquence were were all all called called into into play play to to charm charm and and move move and and
plunge plunge into into a a profound profound and and strange strange intoxication intoxication this this noble noble and and tender tender
heart heart which which had had never never known known either either love love or or sorrow can can imagine imagine
that that everything everything helped helped on on the the inevitable inevitable end studies studies them them
to to see see each each other other freely and and also also permitted permitted them them to to be be
alone alone together their their books books lay lay open open between between them but but either either long long
periods periods of of silence silence their their reading or or else else words words of of deepening deepening
intimacy intimacy made made them them forget forget their their studies studies altogether eyes eyes of of the the two two
lovers lovers turned turned from from the the book book to to mingle mingle their their glances and and then then to to turn turn
away away in in a a confusion confusion that that was was conscious

would would touch touch hand apparently apparently by by accident and and when when conversation conversation
would would often often hear hear the the long quivering quivering sigh sigh which which
the the strange and and yet yet exquisite exquisite joy joy which which
experienced

was was not not long long before before the the heart heart had had been been wholly wholly won
by by her her emotion she she met met the the of of her her lover lover with with
those those as as unrestrained unrestrained as as his very very innocence innocence deprived deprived her her of of the the
protection protection which which older older would would have have had was was given given freely and and
even even wildly by by and and all all was was taken taken by by who who
himself himself declared

pleasure pleasure of of teaching teaching her her to to love love the the delightful delightful
fragrance fragrance of of all all the the perfumes perfumes in in the the world

these these two two could could not not always always live live in in a a paradise paradise which which was was entirely entirely
their their own world world of of notice notice of of their their close close association
written written to to by by as as if if in in letters letters of of fire
were were found found and and shown shown to to who until until this this time had had suspected suspected
nothing he he ordered ordered to to leave leave his his house his his
niece niece to to see see her her lover lover any any more

the the two two could could not not be be separated and indeed there there was was good good reason reason
why why they they should should still still cling cling together left left her her uncles
house house and and fled fled through through the the narrow narrow of of to to the the dwelling dwelling of of
sister where where himself himself was was living
presently the the young young girl girl birth birth to to a a son who who was was named named
after after an an instrument instrument used used by by since since both both the the father father and and the the
mother mother felt felt that that the the offspring offspring of of so so great great a a love love should should have have no no
ordinary ordinary name

was was furious and and rightly rightly so hospitality hospitality had had been been
and and his his niece niece dishonored that that the the pair pair should should at at once once be be
married was was revealed revealed a a certain certain weakness weakness in in the the character character of of
to to the the marriage but but that that it it should should be be
kept kept an an utter utter secret

enough it it was was herself herself who who to to becoming becoming the the wife wife
of of the the man man she she loved could could go go no no farther saw saw that
were were he he to to marry marry her his his advancement advancement in in the the would would be be almost almost
impossible for while while the the very very minor minor clergy clergy sometimes sometimes married married in in spite spite
of of the the papal papal bulls matrimony matrimony was was becoming becoming a a fatal fatal bar bar to to
ecclesiastical ecclesiastical promotion so so pitifully both both with with
her her uncle uncle and and with with that that there there should should be be no no marriage would would
rather rather bear bear all all manner manner of of disgrace disgrace than than stand stand in in the the way way of of
advancement

has has himself himself given given some some of of the the words words in in which which she she with with him

glory glory shall shall win win from from you when when have have made made you you quite quite inglorious inglorious
and and have have humbled humbled both both of of us vengeance vengeance will will the the world world inflict inflict on on
me me if if deprive deprive it it of of one one so so brilliant curses curses will will follow follow such such a a
marriage outrageous outrageous would would it it be be that that you whom whom nature nature created created for for
the the universal universal good should should be be devoted devoted to to one one woman woman and and plunged plunged into into
such such disgrace loathe loathe the the thought thought of of a a marriage marriage which which would would humiliate humiliate
you

every every possible possible effort effort which which another another woman woman in in her her place place would would
employ employ to to make make him him marry marry her her she she used used in in order order to to dissuade dissuade him
her her sweet sweet face face streaming streaming with with tears she she uttered uttered that that
tremendous tremendous sentence sentence which which makes makes one one really really think think that that she she loved loved him him as as
no no other other woman woman ever ever loved loved a a man out in in an an agony agony of of
selfsacrifice

would would rather rather be be your your mistress mistress than than the the wife wife even even of of an an emperor

the the two two were were married and and to to his his
and and to to his his studies months months they they met met but but seldom
however the the and and directed directed against against
so so that that he he broke broke his his promise promise of of secrecy and and told told his his
friends friends that that and and were were man man and and wife to to
for for confirmation more more she she in in an an extraordinary extraordinary way way
the the depth depth of of her her devotion

am am no no wife she she said is is not not true true that that has has married married me
uncle uncle merely merely you you this this to to save save my my reputation

asked asked her her whether whether she she would would swear swear to to this and without without a a moments
hesitation this this pure pure and and noble noble woman woman an an oath oath upon upon the the
that that there there had had been been no no marriage

was was by by this and furthermore
he he to to visit visit her girl therefore again again left left her her
uncles house house and and herself herself to to a a convent convent just just outside outside of of
where where she she assumed assumed the the habit habit of of a a nun nun as as a a disguise
continued continued from from time time to to time time to to meet meet her

heard heard of of this this he he put put his his own own interpretation interpretation on on it
believed believed that that intended intended to to ignore ignore the the marriage marriage altogether and and
that that possibly possibly he he might might even even marry marry some some other other woman any any case he he now now
hated hated with with all all his his heart and and he he resolved resolved to to take take a a fearful fearful and and
unnatural unnatural vengeance vengeance which which would would at at once once prevent prevent his his enemy enemy from from making making
any any other other marriage while while at at the the same same time time it it would would debar debar him him from from
ecclesiastical ecclesiastical preferment

carry carry out out his his plot plot first first a a man man who who was was the the
of of at at the the door door of of his his room room each each night
he he hired hired the the services services of of four four had had retired retired
and and was was deep deep in in slumber slumber the the treacherous treacherous valet valet unbarred unbarred the the door
of of entered entered and and fell fell upon upon the the sleeping sleeping man of of
them them bound bound him him fast while while the the fourth with with a a razor on on him him
the the most most shameful shameful mutilation mutilation that that is is possible the the
lights the the away away and and were were lost lost in in darkness leaving leaving
behind behind their their victim victim bound bound to to his his couch of of torment torment and and
bathed bathed in in his his own own blood

is is a a shocking shocking story and and yet yet it it is is intensely intensely characteristic characteristic of of the the
lawless lawless and and barbarous barbarous era era in in which which it it the the next next morning morning
the the news news through through city city like like a a beehive
and and and and into into the the street street and and
surrounded surrounded the the house house of of

the the entire entire city as as by by
toward toward his his house as as if if each each one one had had lost lost her her
husband

though though he he was still still retained retained enough enough of of the the spirit spirit of of
his his time time to to seek seek vengeance in in his his turn employed employed whom whom he he
set set upon upon the the track track of of those those who who had had assaulted assaulted him treacherous treacherous
valet valet and and one one of of were were run run down seized and and
mutilated mutilated precisely precisely as as had had been and and their their eyes eyes were were blinded
third third was was in in prison himself himself was was accused accused before before one one of of
the the courts which which alone alone had had power power to to punish punish an an ecclesiastic and and
all all his his goods goods were were

meantime how how did did it it fare fare with with grief grief was was greater greater than than
his his own while while her her love love and and her her devotion devotion were were absolutely absolutely undiminished
now now a a indeed a a
beyond beyond any any that that he he had had before before could could no no more more be be his his
wife made made it it plain plain that that he he put put no no trust trust in in her her fidelity was was
unwilling unwilling that that she she should should live live in in the the world world while while he he could could not and and so so
he he told told her her sternly sternly that that she she must must take take the the veil veil and and bury bury herself herself for for
ever ever in in a a nunnery

pain pain and and shame shame which which she she experienced experienced at at this this came came wholly wholly from from the the
fact fact that that did did not not trust trust her she she wrote

knows knows should should not not have have at at your your command to to precede precede or or
to to follow follow you you to to hell hell itself

was was his his distrust distrust that that cut cut her her to to the the heart her her love love for for him him
was was so so intense intense that that she she obeyed obeyed his his order after after she she the the vows
and and in in the the convent convent chapel shaken shaken with with she she before before the the altar altar
and and assumed assumed the the veil veil of of a a cloistered cloistered nun himself himself put put on on the the
black black tunic tunic of of a a monk monk and and entered entered the the of of

is is unnecessary unnecessary here here to to follow follow out out all all the the details details of of the the lives lives of of
and and after after this this scene passed passed
through through many many years years of of strife strife and and disappointment and and even even of of
humiliation for for on on one one occasion just just as as he he had had silenced silenced de de
so so he he himself himself was was silenced silenced and and put put to to rout rout by by of of
frail tense absorbed dominant dominant little little man whose whose face face
was was white white and and worn worn with with suffering but but in in whose whose eyes eyes there there was was a a light light
of of supreme supreme strength represented represented pure pure faith as as
represented represented pure pure reason and and the the two two men men met met before before a a great great council council to to
match match their their respective respective powers

with with fiery fiery eloquence brought brought a a charge charge of of heresy heresy against against
in in an an oration oration which which was was like like a a charge charge of of cavalry he he had had
rose rose with with an an ashen ashen face out out a a few few words
and and sat sat down was was condemned condemned by by the the council and and his his works works were were
ordered ordered to to be be burned

his his later later life life was was one one of of misfortune of of humiliation and and even even of of
personal personal danger whom whom he he tried tried to to rule rule rose rose fiercely fiercely
against against him life life was was threatened himself himself to to a a desolate desolate
and and lonely lonely place where where he he built built for for himself himself a a hut hut of of and and
hoping hoping to to spend spend his his final final years years in in meditation there there were were many many who who
had had not not forgotten forgotten his his ability ability as as a a teacher by by hundreds hundreds
to to the the desert desert place place where where he he abode hut hut was was surrounded surrounded by by tents tents and and
rude rude built built by by his his for for their their shelter

this this time time no no word word had had passed passed between between him him and and presently presently
wrote wrote and and to to the the world world a a curious curious and and exceedingly exceedingly frank frank
book which which he he called called of of copy copy of of it it

series series of of letters letters which which have have unique unique in in the the literature literature of of love

years years had had passed and and yet yet the the heart heart was was as as faithful faithful and and as as
full full of of yearning yearning as as on on the the day day when when the the two two had had parted has has been been
said said that that the the letters letters are are not not genuine and and they they must must be be read read with with this this
assertion assertion in in mind yet yet it it is is difficult difficult to to believe believe that that any any one one save save
herself herself could could have have a a human human soul soul into into such such
passionate passionate or or that that any any imitator imitator could could have have done done the the work

her her first first letter which which was was sent sent to to written written upon upon parchment
she she said

led led her her into into the the of of pleasure in in a a letter
friendly friendly to to be be sure but but letter letter of of a a priest priest to to a a cloistered cloistered

only only too too well well that that not not in in this this life life could could there there be be
anything anything save save spiritual spiritual love love between between himself himself and and wrote wrote to to

matters matters of of theology theology and and ethics but but he he never never one one word word to to feed feed
the the flame flame that that is is consuming consuming her woman woman understood understood at at last and and by by
degrees degrees her her letters letters became became as as calm calm as as however with with a a
tenderness tenderness and and feeling feeling which which that that in in her her heart heart of of hearts hearts she she was was

has has many many romantic romantic to to tell tell of of the the part part which which have have
played played in in the the of of nations it it is is a a
beauty beauty that that causes causes the the shifting shifting of of a a province it it is is
another another rich rich possessions possessions that that incite incite invasion invasion and and lead lead to to
bloody bloody or or or or the the refusal refusal of of marriages marriages and and the the
lack lack of of inheritance inheritance through through an an heiress the the failure failure of of a a male male
these these and and in in many many other other ways ways have have set set their their mark mark
indelibly indelibly upon upon the the trend trend of of history

if if we we look look over over these these different different events events we we shall shall find find that that it it
is is not not so so much much the the mere mere longing longing for for a a desire desire to to have have her her as as
a a has has seriously seriously affected affected the the annals annals of of any any nation
like like ordinary ordinary men have have paid paid their their suit suit and and then then have have away away
yet yet not not seriously seriously dejected royal royal marriages marriages are are made made

delight delight in in some some sheltered sheltered bower bower remote remote from from courts courts than than in in the the

been been with with all all the the appurtenances appurtenances of of legitimacy

are are not not many many that that hang hang persistently persistently about about the the lovemaking
of of a a single single woman the the case case of of one one or or another another we we may may find find an an episode episode
or or dashing something something spirited spirited or or striking something something
brilliant brilliant and and exhilarating or or something something sad for for a a whole whole
life life to to be be spent spent in in courtship courtship that that meant meant nothing nothing and and that that was was only only a a
clever clever aid aid to to is is surely surely an an unusual unusual and and really really wonderful wonderful
thing

is is the the more more unusual unusual because because the the woman woman herself herself was was not not intended intended by by
nature nature to to be be wasted wasted upon upon the the cold cold and and cheerless cheerless sport sport of of chancellors chancellors
and and and and men men who who had had no no thought thought of of her her except except to to use use her her as as a a
pawn was was hotblooded from from a a fiery fiery race and and one one whose whose
temper temper was was quick quick to to leap leap into into the the passion passion of of a a man

this this phase phase of of the the long long and and interesting interesting life life of of of of
we we must must notice notice several several important important facts the the first first place she she
herself above above all all else to to the the maintenance maintenance of of an an
that that would would be be half half or or half half or or even even partly partly
and and but but the the of of that that was was
one one and and undivided with with its its growing growing freedom freedom of of thought its its and and
bills its its nutbrown ale its its sturdy sturdy yeomen and and its its loyalty loyalty to to crown crown
and and once once said almost almost as as in in an an agony

love love more more than than anything

one one may may really really hold hold that that this this was was true

she she and and planned she she up up many many of of
her her royal royal rights she she into into of of treachery
she she left left herself herself on on record record as as an an arrant arrant liar false
perjured yet yet successful and and because because of of her her success success for for sake sake
her her will will hold hold her her in in high high remembrance since since her her
and and her her falsehood falsehood are are the the that that one one pardons pardons most most readily readily in in a a
woman

the the second second place it it must must be be remembered remembered that that
and and pretended pretended were were almost almost always always a a part part of of her her diplomacy
not not a a part part of of her her diplomacy diplomacy they they were were a a mere mere appendage appendage to to her her
vanity seem seem to to be be the the flower flower of of the the people and and to to be be
surrounded surrounded by by the the noblest the the and and the the most most handsome handsome
not not only only of of her her own own kingdom but but of of was
indeed a a choice choice morsel morsel of of which which she she was was fond fond of of tasting even even though though
it it meant meant nothing nothing beyond beyond the the moment

though though at at times times she she could could be be very very cold and and though though she she made made
herself herself still still in in order order that that she she might might play play fast fast and and loose loose with with
foreign foreign who who played played fast fast and and loose loose with with of of
the the brother brother of of the the king with with an an
archduke with with a a magnificent magnificent barbarian barbarian prince prince of of with with of of
or or any any other other felt felt a a need need for for
some some nearer nearer and and more more tender tender association association to to which which she she might might give give
play play and and in in which which she she might might feel feel those those without without the the
danger danger that that when when love love is is mingled mingled with with diplomacy

us us first first consider consider a a picture picture of of the the woman woman as as she she really really was was in in order order
that that we we may may understand understand her her triple triple mistress mistress of of every every
art art that that know and and using using at at every every moment moment her her person person as as a a
lure a a vainglorious queen queen who who to to be be the the prey prey of of boundless boundless
vanity and a a woman woman who who had had all all a a passion and and who who
could could cast cast suddenly suddenly aside aside the the check check and and balance balance which which restrained restrained her her
before before the the public public gaze gaze and and could could allow allow herself herself to to give give full full play play to to the the
emotion emotion that that she she inherited inherited from from the the king her her father who who was was himself himself a a
marvel marvel of of fire fire and and impetuosity the the daughter daughter of of and and
should should be be a a gentle timid timid maiden maiden would would be be to to make make heredity heredity
a a farce

was was about about twenty-five twentyfive years years of of age age when when she she the the
throne throne of of is is odd odd that that the the date date of of her her birth birth cannot cannot be be given given
with with precision and and of of the the court
and and the the fact fact that that she she was was a a princess made made her her birth birth a a matter matter of of less less
account account than than if if there there had had been been no no male male heir heir to to the the throne any any rate
when when she she it after after the the deaths deaths of of her her brother
and and her her sister she she was was a a woman woman well well trained trained both both in in
intellect intellect and and in in physical physical development

who who loves loves to to dwell dwell upon upon the the later later years years of of
speaks speaks rather rather bitterly bitterly of of her her as as a a painted old old harridan
and and such such she she may may well well have have when at at nearly nearly seventy seventy years years of of age
she she and and a a sort sort of of skeleton skeleton smile smile at at the the handsome handsome young young
who who pretended pretended to to see see in in her her the the queen queen of of beauty beauty and and to to be be
dying dying for for love love of of her

in in her her earlier earlier years when when she she was was young young and and strong strong and and impetuous
she she deserved deserved far far different different words words than than these portrait portrait of of her her by by
which which now now hangs hangs in in her her when when she she must must
have have been been of of more more than than middle middle age and and still still the the face face is is one one of of beauty
though though it it be be a a strange strange and and almost almost artificial artificial that that
and perhaps you you on on against against your your will

is is interesting interesting to to compare compare this this painting painting with with the the frank frank
of of a a certain certain agent agent who who was was sent sent to to by by his his emperor and and
who who seems seems to to have have been been greatly greatly fascinated fascinated by by was was
at at that that time time in in the the prime prime of of her her beauty beauty and and her her power complexion complexion
was was of of that that peculiar peculiar transparency transparency which which is is seen seen only only in in the the face face of of
golden golden figure figure was was fine fine and and graceful and and her her wit wit an an
accomplishment accomplishment that that would would have have made made a a woman woman of of any any rank rank or or time time
remarkable envoy envoy

lives lives a a life life of of such such magnificence magnificence and and feasting feasting as as can can hardly hardly be be
imagined and and a a great great portion portion of of her her time time with with balls
hunting and and similar similar with with the the utmost utmost possible possible
display but but nevertheless nevertheless she she upon upon far far greater greater respect respect being being
shown shown her her than than was was by by summons summons but but
lets lets them them know know that that her her orders orders must must be be obeyed obeyed in in any any case

any any one one will will look look at at the the painting painting by by he he will will see see how how much much
is is made made of of distinctive distinctive feature feature quite quite as as noble noble with with
the the as as is is the the lip among among the the descendants descendants of of the the house house
of of were were and and were were very very long long and and white and and she she
at at them them and and played played with with them them a a great great deal and indeed they they
justified justified the the admiration admiration with with which which they they were were by by her her


was was the the personal personal appearance appearance of of a a young young girl we we
have have still still more more favorable favorable opinions opinions of of her her that that were were written written by by those those
who who had had occasion occasion to to be be near near her only only do do they they record record swift swift
of of her her person but but sometimes sometimes in in a a word word or or two two they they give give an an insight insight into into
certain certain traits traits of of mind mind which which came came out out prominently prominently in in her her later later years

may perhaps be be well well to to view view her her as as a a woman woman before before we we regard regard her her
more more fully fully as as a a queen has has been been said said that that inherited inherited many many
of of the the traits traits of of her her boldness boldness of of spirit the the rapidity rapidity of of
decision and at at the the same same time the the craft craft which which often often
itself itself when when it it was was least least expected

had had also as as is is well well known a a love love of of the the other other sex which which has has
made made his his reign reign memorable yet yet it it must must be be noted noted that that while while he he loved loved
much it it was was not not loose loose love a a king king of of from from to to
has has offended offended far far more more than than loved
he he married and and it it was was the the unfortunate unfortunate result result of of these these royal royal marriages marriages
that that has has made made him him seem seem unduly unduly fond fond of of however we we examine examine
each each one one of of the the separate separate espousals espousals we we shall shall find find that that he he did did not not enter enter
into into it it lightly and and that that he he broke broke it it off off unwillingly ardent ardent
temperament therefore was was checked checked by by a a certain certain rational rational or or
conventional conventional propriety so so that that he he was was by by no no means means a a loose loose liver as as
many many would would make make him him out out to to be

must must remember remember this this when when we we recall recall the the that that have have been been made made
against against and and the the strange strange that that were were told told of of her her
no no means means seemly seemly she she used used to to play play with with her her
guardian she she with with him him in in her her
were were made made the the subject subject of of an an official official inquiry yet yet it it came came
out out that that while while was was less less than than sixteen and and was was
very very much much her her senior his his wife wife was was with with him him on on his his visits visits to to the the
chamber chamber of of the the princess

and and his his wife wife were were also also sent sent to to question question her
had had a a keen keen mind mind and and one one well well trained trained to to cope cope with with any any others
wit wit in in this this sort sort of of crossexamination was was only only a a girl girl of of
fifteen yet yet she she was was a a match match for for the the accomplished accomplished courtier courtier in in diplomacy diplomacy
and and quick quick retort was was sent sent down down to to worm worm out out of of her her everything everything that that
she she and and flattery flattery and and forged forged letters letters and and false false confessions confessions
were were tried tried on on her but but they they were were tried tried in in vain would would tell tell nothing nothing
of of importance denied denied everything she she she she
herself herself of of a a favorite favorite defense defense in in suddenly suddenly attacking attacking
those those who who had had her brought brought counter counter against against
and and put put her her on on their their own own defense a a compromising compromising
word word could could they they wring wring out out of of her

bitterly bitterly of of the the imprisonment imprisonment of of her her governess
and and out

have have not not so so behaved behaved that that you you need need put put more more upon upon me

she she was was too too much much for for and and he he was was wise wise enough enough to to
recognize recognize her her cleverness

hath hath a a very very good good wit said said he and nothing nothing is is to to be be
of of her her except except by by great great policy he he added had had to to say say
my my fancy think think it it more more meet meet that that she she should should have have two two
than than one

notes notes the the fact fact that that after after the the two two of of the the princess princess had had
been been and and had had told told nothing nothing very very serious serious they they found found that that they they
had had been been wise wise in in remaining remaining friends friends of of the the royal royal girl sooner sooner had had
become become queen queen than than she she the the man man and and made made him him
treasurer treasurer of of the the household while while the the governess was was
treated treated with with great great consideration very very naturally
had had probably probably kept kept back back far far more more than than they they told

believed believed that that there there was was a a secret secret compact compact between between them
for for he he said quaintly all all sing sing one one song and and she she hath hath set set the the
note note for for them

after after this this her her brother brother death death brought brought to to the the throne throne her her
elder elder sister who who has has harshly harshly become become known known as as
this this time time put put aside aside her her boldness and and became became apparently apparently a a shy shy
and and simple-minded simpleminded virgin on on every every side side by by those those who who sought sought
to to trap trap her there there was was nothing nothing in in her her bearing bearing to to make make her her seem seem the the head head
of of a a party party or or the the young young chief chief of of a a faction could could exceed exceed her her in in
meekness spoke spoke of of her her sister sister in in the the terms
no no signs signs of of the the animation animation that that was was in in reality reality so so strong strong a a part part of of
her her character

coming coming to to the the throne she she away away her her modesty modesty and and and and
with with very very little little selfrestraint people people as as a a whole whole found found
little little fault fault with with her them them of of her her father the the bluff bluff
and and even even those those who who her her did did so so only only partially
thought thought much much better better of of her her than than they they had had of of her her saturnine saturnine sister the the
first first

life life of of has has been been very very misunderstood not not so so much much
for for the the facts facts in in it it as as for for the the manner manner in in which which these these have have been been arranged arranged
and and the the relation relation which which they they have have to to one one another ought ought to to recollect recollect
that that this this woman woman did did not not live live in in a a restricted restricted sphere that that her her life life was was
not not a a short short one and and that that it it was was crowded crowded with with and and full full of of
vivid vivid color think think of of her her as as living living for for a a short short period period of of time time and and
speak speak of of the the great great historical historical who who surrounded surrounded her her as as
belonging belonging to to a a single single epoch them them she she has has one one set set of of all all the the
the the of of brother the the of of
the the russian russian potentate the the archduke archduke sending sending her her sweet sweet
from from the the melancholy melancholy of of together together with with a a number number of of
her her own own brilliant brilliant
the the of of and and


course as as a a matter matter of of fact lived lived for for nearly nearly seventy seventy
of of a a in in that that long long time time there there
came came and and both both men men and and those those whom whom she she had had used used and and cast cast
aside with with others others whom whom she she had had also also treated treated with with gratitude and and who who
had had gladly gladly serving serving her through through it it all all there there was was a a continual continual
change change in in her her environment though though not not in in her young young soldier soldier to to
the the battlefield and and the the wise wise counselor counselor her her his his advice and and
she she either either it it or or nothing nothing for for it herself herself was was a a curious curious
blending blending of of forwardness forwardness and and folly of of wisdom wisdom and and of of
frivolity frivolity and and unbridled unbridled fancy through through it it all all she she loved loved her her people
even even though though she she often often them them and and made made them them pay pay her her taxes taxes in in the the
harsh harsh old old way way that that before before there there was was any any right right save save the the kings
will

the the same same time this this was was only only by by fits fits and and starts and and on on the the whole whole
she she served served them them well to to most most of of them them she she was was always always the the
good good it it to to the the and and yeoman far far from from
the the court that that the the queen queen was was said said to to dance dance in in her her and and to to
swear swear like like a a trooper

was indeed largely largely from from these these rustic rustic sources sources that that such such
were were scattered scattered throughout throughout thought thought them them picturesque
to to the the point point with with them them were were peace peace and and prosperity prosperity throughout throughout the the
country the the fact fact that that law law was was with with honesty honesty and and justice
and and that that was was safe safe from from her her deadly deadly swarthy swarthy
and and the the

as as said we we must must remember remember always always that that the the of of one one
period period was was not not the the of of another and and that that the the of of one one
period period was was not not the the of of another one one thinks thinks of of it there there is is
something something wonderful wonderful in in the the almost almost starlike way way in in which which this this girl girl
unharmed unharmed through through a a thousand thousand own own were were at at
first first divided divided against against her a a score score of of greedy avaricious avaricious sought sought
her her destruction or or at at least least her her hand hand to to lead lead her her to to destruction all all
the the great great powers powers of of the the were were either either demanding demanding an an alliance alliance
with with or or threatening threatening to to dash dash down down amid amid their their own own


had had this this girl girl to to play play off off against against such such an an undaunted undaunted
spirit a a mind mind that that no no and and finally finally her her own own
person person and and the the fact fact that that she she was was a a woman and therefore might might give give
herself herself in in marriage marriage and and become become the the mother mother of of a a race race of of kings

was was this this last last weapon the the weapon weapon of of her her sex that that proved perhaps
the the most most powerful powerful of of all promising promising a a marriage marriage or or by by denying denying it or or
by by neither neither promising promising nor nor denying denying but but withholding withholding it she she forth forth a a
thousand thousand wily wily which which kept kept those those who who surrounded surrounded her her at at bay bay
until until she she had had made made still still another another deft deft and and combination
like like some some startled startled creature creature to to a a new new place place of of safety

when when she she was was fifty fifty years years of of age she she had had a a point point when when
her her and and her her pretended pretended lovemaking were were no no longer longer necessary
had had played played against against and and against against and and
the the archduke archduke against against the the others and and many many in in her her own own
land land against against the the different different which which they they headed might might have have
sat sat herself herself down down to to rest for for she she could could feel feel that that her her wisdom wisdom had had led led
her her up up into into a a high high place whence whence she she might might look look down down in in peace peace and and with with
assurance assurance of of the the tranquillity tranquillity that that she she had had won yet yet had had the the great great
rolled rolled and and toward toward the the she she was was
certain certain that that her her land land was was secure compact and and safe

remains remains to to see see what what were were those those amatory amatory relations relations which which she she may may be be
said said to to have have sincerely sincerely held had had played played at at lovemaking with with foreign foreign
because because it it was was wise wise and for for the the moment best had had played played
with with of of rank rank who who to to her her hand because because in in that that way way
she she might might conciliate at at one one time time her her and and at at another another her her
what what of of the the real real and and inward inward feeling feeling of of her her
heart when when she she was was not not thinking thinking of of political political or or the the
necessities necessities of of state

is is an an interesting interesting question may may at at least least seek seek the the answer
hoping hoping thereby thereby to to solve solve one one of of the the most most interesting interesting phases phases of of this this
perplexing perplexing and and most most remarkable remarkable woman

must must be be remembered remembered that that it it was was not not a a question question of of whether whether
desired desired marriage may may have have done done so so as as a a brilliant brilliant stroke stroke
of of policy this this sense sense she she may may have have wished wished to to marry marry one one of of the the two two
who who were were among among her her even even here here she she
and and her her disapproved for for by by this this time time had had become become
largely largely had had she she married married a a prince prince and and had had
children might might have have become become an an appanage appanage of of

is is no no particular particular evidence evidence that that she she had had any any feeling feeling at at all all for for her her
or or while while the the pretensions pretensions
were were the the laughingstock of of the the court we we may may set set aside aside this this
question question of of marriage marriage as as having having nothing nothing to to do do with with her her emotional emotional life
did did desire desire a a son as as was was shown shown by by her her passionate passionate outcry outcry when when she she
compared compared herself herself with with of of

of of has has a a bonny bonny son while while am am but but a a barren barren stock

was was too too wise wise to to wed wed a a subject though had had she she married married at at all her her
choice choice would would doubtless doubtless have have been been an an this this respect as as in in
so so many many others she she was was like like her her father who who chose chose his his numerous numerous wives
with with the the exception exception of of the the first from from among among the the of of the the
court just just as as the the showy showy was was happy happy in in
what what a a king king may may do do is is by by no no means means so so easy easy for for
a a queen and and a a husband husband is is almost almost certain certain to to assume assume an an authority authority which which
makes makes him him unpopular unpopular with with the the of of his his wife

as as said said above we we must must consider consider not not so so much much whom whom she she would would have have
liked liked to to marry but but rather rather to to whom whom her her love love out out spontaneously and and
not not as as a a part part of of that that amatory amatory play play which which amused amused her her from from the the time time when when
she she with with down down to to the the very very last last days when when she she could could no no
longer longer move move about but but when when she she still still dabbled dabbled her her cheeks cheeks with with rouge rouge and and
powder powder and and set set her her skeleton skeleton face face amid amid a a forest forest of of

were were many many whom whom she she for for after after a a fashion would would not not let let
visit visit her her because because she she could could not not
bear bear to to have have him him so so long long away away from from her had had great great moments moments of of
passion passion for for the the of of though though in in the the end end she she signed signed his his
because because he he was was as as dominant dominant in in spirit spirit as as the the queen queen herself

of of wonderfully wonderfully picturesque picturesque novel
will will note note how how he he the the strongest strongest light light upon upon
affection affection for for of of
historical historical instinct instinct is is united united here here with with a a vein vein of of psychology psychology which which goes goes
than than is is usual usual with with him see see trying trying hard hard to to share share
her her favor favor equally equally between between two two but but the the of of fails fails to to
please please her her because because he he those those exquisite exquisite manners manners which which made made
so so great great a a favorite favorite with with the the fastidious fastidious queen

too the the story story of of marriage marriage with with is is
something something more more than than a a myth based based upon upon an an obscure obscure legend legend and and an an ancient ancient
ballad earl earl had had had had such such a a wife and and there there were were sinister sinister
about about the the manner manner of of her her death it it is is who who the the
and and the the bulldog bulldog just just as as he he brought brought
the the whole whole episode episode into into the the foreground foreground and and made made it it occur occur at at a a period period
much much later later than than was was historically historically true he he was was
imbued imbued with with the the spirit spirit and and knowledge knowledge of of that that strong strong conviction conviction
that that loved loved as as she she really really loved loved no no one one else

is is one one interesting interesting fact fact which which goes goes far far to to convince convince us as as
her her father father was in in a a way polygamous so so was was even even more more truly truly
polyandrous was was inevitable inevitable that that she she should should surround surround herself herself with with
attractive attractive men whose whose she she would would caress caress and and whose whose
she she would would accept the the outward outward eye eye there there was was very very little little
difference difference in in her her treatment treatment of of the the handsome handsome and and daring daring of of her her
court yet yet a a historian historian of of her her time time makes makes one one very very shrewd shrewd remark remark when when he he
every every one one she she some some power power at at all all save save


and and in in counsel counsel and and and and in in the the field field
might might have have their their own own way way at at times and and even even share share the the
power but but to to she she no no high high and and no no important important
mission so because because she she loved loved him him more more than than any any of of the the
rest and knowing knowing this she she that that if if besides besides her her love love she she granted granted
him him any any measure measure of of control control or or power then then she she would would be be but but half half a a queen queen
and and would would be be led led either either to to marry marry him him or or else else to to let let him him sway sway her her as as he he
would

the the reason reason given one one may may say say with with confidence confidence that while while
light light loves loves were were fleeting she she a a deep deep affection affection to to
this this handsome bold and and brilliant brilliant and and cherished cherished him him in in a a
far far different different way way from from any any of of the the others was was as as near near as as she she ever ever
came came to to marriage and and it it was was this this love love at at least least which which makes makes
famous famous line line as as false false as as it it is is beautiful when when he he
the imperial imperial as as passing passing by by in maiden maiden meditation
fancy fancy free







and and are are the the two two who who have have most most the the
fancy fancy of of poets and and from from their their own own
time time down down to to the the present present day

some some respects respects there there is is a a certain certain likeness likeness in in their their was was
queen queen of of a a nation nation whose whose affairs affairs were were entangled entangled with with those those of of a a much much
greater greater one sought sought for for her her own own ideal ideal of of love love until until she she found found it
won won that that love love recklessly almost almost madly in in its its attainment
fell fell from from power power and and fortune before before her her natural natural life life was was
ended caused caused the the man man she she loved loved to to cast cast away away the the sovereignty sovereignty of of a a
mighty mighty state other other lost lost her her own own crown crown in in order order that that she she might might
achieve achieve the the whole whole desire desire of of her her heart

is is still still another another parallel parallel which which may may be be found of of these these
was was to to be be exquisitely exquisitely beautiful yet yet each each fell fell short short of of
highest highest are are alike alike remembered remembered in in song song and and story story
because because of of qualities qualities that that are are far far more more powerful powerful than than any any physical physical charm charm
can can be impressed impressed the the imagination imagination of of their their own own just just
as as they they had had impressed impressed the the imagination imagination of of all all succeeding succeeding ages by by reason reason
of of a a strange strange and and irresistible irresistible fascination fascination which which no no one one could could explain
but but which which very very few few could could experience experience and and resist

corruption corruption which which she she had had brought brought from from her her native native was indeed
a a singular singular for for a a girl girl of of character

like like the the life life of of the the court court with with exquisite exquisite verse

and and gallantry gallantry of of bearing yet on on the the other other hand there there was was
every every possible possible refinement refinement and and variety variety of of vice were were slain slain before before

to to maintain maintain her her grasp grasp on on she she at at the the corruption corruption of of her her
own own children three three of of whom whom were were destined destined in in their their turn turn to to sit sit upon upon the the
throne

up up in in these these surroundings surroundings until until she she was was sixteen eating eating
the the fruit fruit which which a a knowledge knowledge of of both both good good and and evil
intelligence intelligence was was very very great quickly quickly learned learned and and
was was a a daring daring horsewoman was was a a poet poet and and an an artist artist even even
in in her her teens was was also also a a keen keen judge judge of of human human motives for for those those
early early years years of of hers hers had had forced forced her her into into a a womanhood womanhood that that was was premature premature
but but wonderful had had been been proposed proposed that that she she should should marry marry the the eldest eldest
son son of of so so that that in in time time the the kingdom kingdom of of and and that that of of
might might be be united while while if if of of were were to to die die
unmarried unmarried her her realm realm also also would would fall fall to to this this pair pair of of children

so so at at sixteen wedded wedded the the who who was was a a year year her her
junior prince prince was was a a wretched little little creature with with a a
cankered cankered body body and and a a blighted blighted soul with with such such a a husband husband

husband husband and and she she was was left left a a widow restless ambitious and and yet yet no no
longer longer having having any any of of the the power power she she loved

at at this this time time had had become become a a woman woman whose whose fascination fascination was was
over over all all who who her was was very very tall tall and and very very slim with with
chestnut chestnut hair like a a flower flower of of the the heat both both lax lax and and delicate

story story plausible plausible that that when when she she from from a a flask flask of of wine the the red red
liquid liquid could could be be seen seen passing passing down down her her slender slender throat

her her one one day day one one of of her her own own the the of of was was but but a a
few few years years older older than than she and and in in his his presence presence for for the the first first time time she she
felt in in her her own own despite that that profoundly profoundly moving indescribable and and
thrill thrill which which shakes shakes a a woman woman to to the the very very center center of of
her her being since since it it is is the the recognition recognition of of a a complete complete affinity

of of him him more more favorable favorable than than many and and yet yet it it is is a a picture picture that that
he was was of of a a type type esteemed esteemed by by those those who who pronounce pronounce vice vice
to to be be their their virtue was was a flushed flushed with with rich rich blood
broadshouldered with with a a laugh laugh so so happy happy and and so so prompt prompt
that that the the world rejoicing rejoicing to to hear hear it thought thought all all must must be be well well wherever wherever
he he might might be brave brave clothes sat sat a a brave brave horse and and kept kept brave brave

too bridge bridge of of his his nose nose had had been been broken few few observed observed it or or
at at the the brawl brawl which which must must have have given given it it to to him was was his his
great great charm careless careless ease ease in in high high places

so when when first first met met him him in in her her eighteenth eighteenth year
made made her her think think as as she she had had never never thought thought of of any any other other man and and
as as she she was was not not to to think think of of any any other other man man again to to look look
eagerly eagerly for for the the frank frank mockery mockery in those those twinkling twinkling eyes in in that that quick quick
mouth and and to to wonder wonder whether whether it it was was with with him him at at

also was was perhaps perhaps the the only only noble noble of of his his time time who who had had a a
bookplate of of his his own is is something something more more than than a a mere mere reveler
is is a a man man of of varied varied accomplishments accomplishments and and of of a a complex complex character

he he stayed stayed but but a a short short time time near near the the queen queen in in he he
her her imagination so so that that when when she she seriously seriously thought thought of of men men she she thought thought
of of yet yet all all the the time time she she was was fondling fondling the the young young in in
her her retinue retinue and and kissing kissing her her of of honor honor with with her her scarlet scarlet lips and and
lying lying on on their their knees while while poets poets like like and and wrote wrote
ardent ardent love love to to her her and and and and for for something something more more than than
the the privilege privilege of of kissing kissing her her two two dainty dainty hands

intense intense that that she she should should now now become become the the mother mother of of a a son and and the the king king
himself himself was was no no less less anxious

the the event event occurred the the child child was was seen seen to to be be completely completely covered covered
with with hair and and for for this this reason reason the the at at first first believed believed that that it it
was was the the desired desired boy their their mistake mistake was was discovered discovered they they were were afraid afraid
to to tell tell the the king who who was was waiting waiting in in his his study study for for the the announcement announcement to to

is is customary customary at at almost almost all all courts courts to to pay pay less less attention attention to to the the birth birth
of of a a princess princess than than to to that that of of a a prince but but his his
chivalry chivalry toward toward this this little little daughter whom whom he he named named
ordered ordered that that the the full full royal royal salute salute should should be be in in every every fortress fortress of of
his his kingdom kingdom and and that that of of fireworks balls balls of of honor and and court court

him him to to be be as as such such before before the the assembled assembled of of the the realm
even even had had him him crowned and and finally in in her her twenty-eighth year she she
altogether altogether and and prepared prepared to to leave leave asked asked whither whither
she she would would go she she in in a a quotation

will will show show the the way

her her act act of of abdication abdication she she reserved reserved to to herself herself the the revenues revenues of of some some

king and and that apart apart from from personal personal she she had had ruled ruled them them well
and and so so they they let let her her go go regretfully regretfully and and accepted accepted her her cousin cousin as as their their
king on on her her side and and in in the the spirit spirit of of a a
grand grand adventuress a a numerous numerous suite suite she she entered entered and and then then
stayed stayed for for a a year year at at where where she she
this this she she traveled traveled slowly slowly into into where where she she entered entered on on
horseback and and was was received received by by the the who who her her
in in a a magnificent magnificent palace accepted accepted her her conversion and and her
giving giving her her a a new new name

she she was was a a brilliant brilliant but but erratic erratic personage living living sumptuously
even even though though her her revenues revenues from from came came in in slowly partly partly because because the the
disliked disliked her her change change of of religion was was surrounded surrounded by by men men of of
letters with with whom whom she she amused amused herself and and she she to to herself herself a a lover

beyond beyond a a certain certain time time no no one one could could hold hold the the affections affections of of

after after she she had had with with various various cardinals cardinals and and decided decided to to
leave leave for for a a while accompanied accompanied her her to to where where
she she had had an an immense immense vogue vogue at at the the court court of of wide wide
attention attention because because of of her her eccentricity eccentricity and and utter utter lack lack of of manners

king king was was very very gracious gracious to to her her and and invited invited her her to to his his at at


she she had had been been winning winning of of sarcasm sarcasm the the infatuated infatuated

royal royal mistress mistress was was no no longer longer true true to to him had had been been in in her her
favor favor by by another another one one who who was was the the captain captain of of her her

and and the the queen but but when when the the letters letters were were carried carried to to she she
recognized recognized their their true true source saw saw that that she she was was
by by her her former former favorite favorite and and that that he he had had taken taken a a revenge revenge which which might might
seriously seriously compromise compromise her

led led to to a a tragedy of of which which the the facts facts were were long long obscure were were
carefully carefully recorded however by by the the queens household household chaplain
and and there there is is also also a a narrative narrative written written by by one one
which which the the story were were published published privately privately in in
with with notes notes by by

narration narration of of the the priest priest is is dreadful dreadful in in its its simplicity simplicity and and
minuteness minuteness of of detail may may be be up up briefly briefly here because because it it is is
the the testimony testimony of of an an eyewitness who who

with with the the marquis marquis and and a a large large retinue was was at at
in in little little after after midnight when when all all was was still the the
priest was was aroused aroused and and ordered ordered to to go go at at once once to to the the

at at the the end end of of the the corridor corridor the the queen queen in in somber somber robes the the queen

difficulty difficulty be be made made out out as as three three soldiers soldiers of of her her guard

queen queen to to and and asked asked him him for for a a packet packet which which
she she had had given given him him for for safekeeping some some little little time time before it it
to to her and and she she opened opened it it it were were letters letters and and other other
which with with a a steely steely glance she she to to was was
confused confused by by the the sight sight of of them them and and by by the the incisive incisive words words in in which which
how how he he had had both both her her and and had had tried tried to to shift shift

piteously begging begging for for pardon only only to to be be met met by by the the cold cold answer

are are my my subject subject and and a a traitor traitor to to me you you must must prepare prepare to to
die

she she turned turned away away and and left left the the hall in in spite spite of of the the of of
to to whom whom she she merely merely added added the the advice advice that that he he should should make make
his his peace peace with with by by to to

she she had had gone gone the the marquis marquis fell fell into into a a torrent torrent of of
and and for for mercy three three armed armed men men near near and and him him to to
confess confess for for the the good good of of his his soul to to have have no no malice malice against against
him but but to to feel feel that that they they must must obey obey the the orders orders given given them the the
frantic frantic urging urging of of the the marquis marquis their their leader leader even even to to the the queen queen to to
ask ask whether whether she she would would relent but but he he shaking shaking his his head and and
said

you you must must die

a a like like mission but but with with the the message message
that that there there was was no no hope the the marquis marquis made made his his confession confession in in
and and but but even even then then he he for for he he did did not not wait wait to to receive receive
absolution but but still still further further for for delay delay or or pardon

the the three three armed armed men men having having drawn drawn their their swords
absolution absolution was was pronounced and following following it one one of of the the guards guards slashed slashed
the the marquis marquis across across the the forehead and and fell fell forward making making
signs signs as as if if to to ask ask that that he he might might have have his his throat throat cut his his throat throat

delivered delivered there there had had slight slight effect however a a long narrow narrow
sword sword was was thrust thrust into into his his side after after which which the the marquis marquis made made no no sound

at at once once left left the the des des and and into into the the
queens apartment with with the the smell smell of of blood blood in in his his nostrils found found
her her calm calm and and ready ready to to justify justify herself she she not not still still queen queen over over all all
who who had had voluntarily voluntarily become become members members of of her her suite had had been been agreed agreed
to to in in her her act act of of abdication she she set set her her foot there over over her her
own she she was was still still a a monarch with with full full power power to to punish punish traitors traitors at at her her
will power power she she had had and and with with justice it it
that that she she was was in in was was queen queen as as truly truly as as was was king

story story was was not not long long in in getting getting out but but the the truth truth was was not not wholly wholly
known known until until a a much much later later day was was said said that that had had
the the marquis marquis in in a a fit fit of of jealousy though though some some added added that that it it was was done done
with with the the connivance connivance of of the the queen the the incarnation incarnation of of
absolutism the the truth but but he he was was slow slow to to act with with
the the theory theory of of sovereignty was was only only after after a a time time that that
word word was was sent sent to to that that she she must must leave leave
no no notice notice of of the the order order until until it it suited suited her her convenience and and then then she she
forth forth with with all all the the honors honors of of a a monarch

was was the the most most striking striking episode episode in in all all the the strange strange story story of of her her
private private life her her cousin cousin whom whom she she had had made made king
without without an an heir heir she she sought sought to to recover recover her her crown but but the the of of the the
realm realm refused refused her her claim reduced reduced her her income and and imposed imposed
upon upon her her power then then sought sought the the vacant vacant throne throne of of but but the the
who who desired desired a a weak weak ruler ruler for for their their own own purposes made made
another another choice at at last last she she to to where where the the
received received her her with with a a splendid splendid procession procession and and granted granted her her twelve twelve thousand thousand
a a year year to to make make up up for for her her lessened lessened revenue

this this time time she she lived lived a a life life which which she she made made interesting interesting by by her her
patronage patronage of of learning learning and and exciting exciting by by her her rather rather unseemly unseemly with with
cardinals cardinals and and even even with with the the armed armed retinue retinue through through the the
streets streets with with drawn drawn swords swords and and open open protection protection to to who who had had
taken taken refuge refuge with with her to to criticize criticize the the pontiff who who merely merely
and and said

is is a a woman

the the whole the the end end of of her her life life was was pleasant was was much much admired admired
for for her her sagacity sagacity in in politics words words were were listened listened to to at at every every court court
in in the the classics she she made made beautiful beautiful
and and she she was was as as a a privileged privileged person person whose whose acts acts no no one one
amiss at at and and was was buried buried in in

instead instead of of the the sonorous sonorous epitaph epitaph that that is is inscribed inscribed beside beside her her tomb

indeed that that even even at at this this day day there there are are and and who who

veins veins there there runs runs the the blood are are said said for for her her at at
and and are are drunk drunk to to her her in in rare rare old old wine

course today this this cult cult of of the the is is nothing nothing but but a a fad one one
ever ever to to see see a a on on the the throne it it is is
significant significant of of the the deep deep strain strain of of romance romance which which the the six six who who

may may be be that that the the are are still still loved loved by by many many
because because they they were were unfortunate yet yet this this is is hardly hardly true after after all
of of them them were were fortunate fortunate enough first first of of them an an absurd absurd
creature speaking speaking broad broad timid foolishly foolishly fond fond of of
and and having having none none of of the the dignity dignity of of a a monarch lived lived out out a a lengthy lengthy reign

century in in every every kind kind of of luxury and and a a king

than than there there was was already already a a legend had had there there been been no no
to to carry carry on on the the cult the the would would still still have have passed passed
into into history history as as much much loved loved by by the the people

only only how how very very little little in in former former days days the the people people expected expected of of a a
regnant regnant king have have had had just just a a few few popular popular traits and and
these these have have stood stood out out brilliantly brilliantly against against the the darkness darkness of of the the background

one one could could have have greatly greatly for for the the first first but but was was
indeed indeed a a kingly kingly personage personage when when afar was was handsome as as a a man
fully fully the the princess princess who who became became his his wife had had no no
personal personal was was brave and and good good to to look look upon and and had had a a kingly kingly
mien although although he he sought sought to to make make his his rule rule over over a a
tyranny there there were were many many fine fine old old to to ride ride afield afield for for him him when when
he he raised raised his his standard and and who when when he he for for him him as as a a
martyr

they they while while ruled ruled with with his his iron iron hand
and and when when that that iron iron hand hand was was relaxed relaxed in in death and and poor feeble feeble
away away to to his his countryseat what what wonder wonder is is it it that that young young
came came back back to to and and through through the the streets streets of of
with with a a smile smile for for every every one one and and a a happy happy laugh laugh upon upon his his lips
wonder wonder is is it it that that the the cannon cannon in in the the a a loud loud welcome and and
that that all all over over at at one one season season or or another rose rose and and
fires fires blazed at at heart heart are are not not only only
but but they they are are lovers lovers of of good good cheer cheer and and merrymaking merrymaking and and all all
sorts sorts of of mirth

might might well well at at first first have have a a and and wiser wiser
successor successor to to his his splendid splendid father a a child even he he had had shown shown
himself himself to to be be no no fainthearted creature the the great great broke broke
out out he he had had joined joined his his fathers army met met with with disaster disaster at at
and and was was finally finally shattered shattered by by the the crushing crushing defeat defeat of of which which
inspired inspired most most stirring stirring ballad

was was then then only only a a child child of of twelve and and so so his his followers followers did did
wisely wisely in in hurrying hurrying him him out out of of through through the the and and
to to his his mothers place place of of exile course a a child child so so very very young young
could could be be of of no no value value as as a a leader though though his his presence presence might might prove prove an an
inspiration

however when when he he was was eighteen eighteen years years of of age he he gathered gathered a a
fleet fleet of of eighteen eighteen and and along along the the coast taking taking
which which he he carried carried to to the the he he was was at at
capital during during his his fathers trial he he wrote wrote many many to to the the
and and even even sent sent them them a a blank blank charter which which they they might might
fill fill in in with with any any they they desired desired if if only only they they would would save save and and
restore restore their their king

the the head head of of rolled rolled from from the the block block his his son son

to to an an force and and was was as as
king king and and crowned crowned at at in in ten ten thousand thousand men men he he dashed dashed
into into where where he he there there were were many many who who would would rally rally at at his his
call it it was was then then that that put put forth forth his his supreme supreme military military
genius genius and and with with his his crushed crushed the the royal royal troops troops at at

that that for for the the present present all all was was lost courage courage and and
address address in in covering covering the the flight flight of of his his beaten beaten soldiers but but he he soon soon
to to remaining remaining there there and and in in the the for for
eight eight years years as as a a pensioner pensioner of of that that time time would would fight fight
for for him him far far more more surely surely than than infantry infantry and and horse had had not not been been
called called for for nothing and and tyranny tyranny was was likely likely
to to be be far far more more than than the the heavy heavy hand hand of of one one who who was was born born a a king
at at and and though though he he had had little little money money at at the the time
managed managed to to maintain maintain a a royal royal court such such as as it it was

there there came came out out another another side side of of his his nature a a child child he he had had borne borne
hardship hardship and and privation privation and and had had seen seen the the red red blood blood flow flow upon upon the the
battlefield as as it it were he he allowed allowed a a certain certain sensuous
ease ease to to him red red blood blood should should become become the the
rich rich red red burgundy the the sound sound of of trumpets trumpets and and should should give give
way way to to the the melody melody of of and and would would be be a a king king of of pleasure pleasure if if
he he were were to to be be king king at at all therefore therefore his his court even even in in exile was was
a a court court of of gallantry gallantry and and ease refused refused to to lend lend him him money and and
the the of of would would not not increase increase his his pension but but there there were were many many
who who that that would would not not long long remain remain in in exile and and so so they they
him him what what he he wanted wanted and and until until he he could could give give them them what what they they
would would ask ask for for in in their their turn

at at this this time time was was not not handsome like like his his father complexion complexion
was was swarthy his his figure figure by by no no means means imposing though though always always graceful
he he chose chose he he could could bear bear himself himself with with all all the the dignity dignity of of a a monarch
had had a a singularly singularly pleasant pleasant manner and and a a word word from from him him could could win win over over
the the opponent

old old who who accompanied accompanied their their master master in in exile exile were were like like

foreign foreign ways ways and and longing longing grimly grimly for for the the time time when when they they could could once once more more

have have said she she is is a a historical historical type type of of the the woman woman who who her her
physical physical purity yet yet who who a a sense sense of of honor honor and and of of honesty honesty which which
nothing nothing can can take take from from her are are not not many many such such examples and and
therefore therefore this this one one is is worth worth remembering

concerning concerning her her there there are are many but but not not often often has has their their
real real import import been been detected she she could could twine twine her her arms arms about about the the

is is an an old old saying saying that that to to every every womanly womanly woman woman selfsacrifice is is
almost almost a a necessity necessity of of her her nature make make herself herself of of small small account account as as
compared compared with with the the one one she she loves to to give give freely freely of of herself even even though though
she she may may receive receive nothing nothing in in return to to suffer and and yet yet to to feel feel an an inner inner
poignant poignant joy joy in in all all this this is is a a most most wonderful wonderful trait trait of of
womanhood it it is is akin akin to to the the maternal maternal instinct for for to to the the
mother after after she she has has felt felt the the throb throb of of a a new new life life within within her there there is is
no no sacrifice sacrifice so so great great and and no no anguish anguish so so keen keen that that she she will will not not welcome welcome
it it as as the the outward outward sign sign and and evidence evidence of of her her illimitable illimitable love

most most this this spirit spirit of of selfsacrifice is is checked checked and and kept kept within within
ordinary ordinary bounds bounds by by the the circumstances circumstances of of their their lives many many small small
things things they they do do yield yield and and they they do do suffer yet yet it it is is not not in in yielding yielding and and
in in suffering suffering that that they they find find their their deepest deepest joy

are are some however who who seem seem to to have have been been born born with with an an abnormal abnormal
capacity capacity for for enduring enduring hardship hardship and and mental mental anguish so so that that by by a a sort sort of of
contradiction contradiction they they find find their their happiness happiness in in sorrow are are
endowed endowed with with a a remarkable remarkable degree degree of of sensibility feel feel intensely
moments moments of of grief grief and and disappointment and and even even of of despair there there
over over them them a a sort sort of of melancholy melancholy pleasure is is as as if if they they loved loved
dim dim lights lights and and mournful mournful music music and and scenes scenes full full of of sad sad suggestion

everything everything goes goes well well with with them they they are are unwilling unwilling to to believe believe that that
such such good good fortune fortune will will last anything anything goes goes wrong wrong with with them they they are are
sure sure that that this this is is only only the the beginning beginning of of something something even even worse music music
of of their their lives lives is is written written in in a a minor minor key

for for such such as as these the the world world at at large large has has very very little little
charity speaks speaks slightingly slightingly of of them them as as that that
they they are are fond of of making making scenes regards regards as as an an affectation affectation
something something that that is is really really instinctive instinctive and and inevitable such such
are are beautiful beautiful and and young young and and charming charming they they are are treated treated badly and and this this
is is often often true true in in spite spite of of all all their their natural natural attractiveness for for they they
seem seem to to court court ill ill usage usage as as if if they they were were saying saying

take take us will will give give you you everything everything and and ask ask for for nothing do do
not not expect expect true true and and enduring enduring love not not be be constant constant or or generous generous or or
even even kind know know that that we we shall shall suffer none none the the less in in our our
sorrow sorrow there there will will be be sweetness and and even even in in our our abasement abasement we we shall shall feel feel
a a sort sort of of triumph

history history there there is is one one woman woman who who stands stands out out conspicuously conspicuously as as a a type type of of
her her melancholy melancholy sisterhood one one whose whose life life was was full full of of disappointment disappointment
even even when when she she was was most most successful and and of of indignity indignity even even when when she she was was
most most sought sought after after and and admired woman woman was was
famous famous in in the the annals annals of of the the stage and and still still more more famous famous in in the the annals annals
of of at at any any rate

story story is is linked linked with with that that of of a a man man no no less less remarkable remarkable than than herself
a a hero hero of of chivalry a a marvel marvel of of courage of of fascination and and of of
irresponsibility

long long he he raving raving and and yelling yelling like like a a maniac

was was brought brought up up at at the the washtub and and became became accustomed accustomed to to a a
wandering wandering life in in which which she she from from one one town town to to another she she
had had inherited inherited from from her her mother mother is of of course not not known but but she she had had all all
her her fathers strangely strangely pessimistic pessimistic temper softened softened only only by by the the fact fact
that that she she was was a a girl her her years years she she was was unhappy yet yet her her
unhappiness unhappiness was was largely largely of of her her own own choosing of of her her own own
station station met met life life cheerfully worked worked away away from from dawn dawn till till dusk and and then then
had had their their moments moments of of amusement and and even even jollity with with their their
after after the the fashion fashion of of all all children
was was unhappy unhappy because because she she chose chose to to be was was not not the the washtub that that made made
her her so for for she she had had been been born born to to it nor nor was was it it the the
of of her her father because because to to her at at least he he was was not not unkind
discontent discontent from from her her excessive excessive sensibility

for for a a peasant peasant child child she she had had reason reason to to think think herself herself far far more more
fortunate fortunate than than her her intelligence intelligence was was great was was
awakened awakened in in her her before before she she was was ten ten years years of of age when when she she to to
learn learn and and to to recite recite them as as has has been been said between
the the washtub and and the the and and them them to to the the
admiration admiration of of older older and and wiser wiser people people than than she at at ten ten she she was was a a
very very beautiful beautiful child with with great great lambent lambent eyes an an exquisite exquisite complexion
and and a a lovely lovely form while while she she had had the the further further gift gift of of a a voice voice that that
thrilled thrilled the the listener listener and when when she she chose brought brought tears tears to to every every eye
was indeed a a natural natural elocutionist knowing knowing by by instinct instinct all all those those
of of tone tone and and varied varied which which go go to to the the heart

was was very very like like to to memorize memorize only only such such as as
were were mournful just just as as in in after after life life she she could could win win success success upon upon the the
stage stage only only in in tragic tragic parts would would repeat repeat with with a a sort sort of of ecstasy ecstasy the the
pathetic pathetic that that were were then then admired and and she she was was soon soon able able to to give give up up
her her menial menial work because because many many people people asked asked her her to to their their so so that that
they they could could listen listen to to the the divinely divinely beautiful beautiful voice voice charged charged with with the the
emotion emotion which which was was always always at at her her command

she she was was thirteen thirteen her her father father moved moved to to where where she she was was placed placed
at at very very humble humble school school in in a a very very humble humble quarter quarter of of the the city
even even there there her her genius genius itself itself at at that that early early age number number of of
children children and and young young people probably probably by by formed formed
themselves themselves into into a a theatrical theatrical company company from from the the pure pure love love of of acting
friendly friendly grocer grocer let let them them have have an an empty empty storeroom for for their their
performances and and in in this this storeroom first first acted acted in in
a a tragedy tragedy by by the the part part of of leading leading woman

genius genius for for the the stage stage was was like like the the genius genius of of for for war
had had had had no no teaching had had never never been been inside inside of of any any theater and and yet yet
she she delivered delivered the the magnificent magnificent lines lines with with all all the the power power and and fire fire and and
effectiveness effectiveness of of a a most most accomplished accomplished actress thronged thronged to to see see
her her and and to to feel feel the the tempest tempest of of emotion emotion which which shook shook her her as as she she sustained sustained
her her part which which for for the the moment moment was was as as real real to to her her as as life life itself

first first only only the the people people of of the the neighborhood neighborhood anything anything about about these these
amateur amateur performances but but presently presently a a lady lady of of rank one one du du
came came out out of of curiosity curiosity and and was was fascinated fascinated by by the the little little actress du du
offered offered the the spacious spacious courtyard courtyard of of her her own own house and and fitted fitted it it with with
some some of of the the appurtenances appurtenances of of a a theater that that moment moment the the fame fame of of
spread spread throughout throughout all all courtyard courtyard was was crowded crowded by by
gentlemen gentlemen and and by by people people of of distinction distinction from from the the court and and at at
last last even even by by and and from from the the

is in in fact a a remarkable remarkable tribute tribute to to that that in in her her thirteenth thirteenth
year year she she excited excited so so much much jealousy jealousy among among the the of of the the that that
they they the the law law against against her required required a a royal royal license and and
of of course course poor poor little little company company had had none legal legal
proceedings proceedings were were begun and and the the most most famous famous in in talked talked
of of having having these these clever clever children children imprisoned this this the the company company
sought sought the the precincts precincts of of the the where where no no legal legal warrant warrant could could be be
served served without without the the express express order order of of the the king king himself

for for a a time time the the performances performances still still on as as the the other other
children children were were not not but but merely merely and and in in search search of of fun
the the little little company company broke broke up success however had had determined determined for for
ever ever the the career career of of her her beautiful beautiful face her her lithe lithe and and
exquisite exquisite figure her her golden golden voice and and her her instinctive instinctive art it it was was
plain plain enough enough that that her her future future lay lay upon upon the the stage and and so so at at fourteen fourteen or or
fifteen fifteen she she where where most most leave leave and and
attractive and and having having had had a a practical practical training training in in her her profession

in in that that same same century observed observed that that the the actor actor is is one one
who who does does not not feel feel his his part part at at all but but his his effects effects by by
intellectual intellectual effort effort and and intelligent intelligent observation the the figure figure on on
the the stage torn torn with with passion passion or or rollicking rollicking with with mirth there there must must
always always be be the the cool cool and and unemotional unemotional mind mind which which and and and and
same same theory theory was was both both held held and and by by the the late late
some some extent extent it it was was the the theory theory of of
and and and and though though it it was was rejected rejected by by the the two two
and and by by who who entered entered so so into into the the character character which which
he he assumed and and who who let let loose loose such such tremendous tremendous of of passion passion that that
other other to to support support him him on on the the stage stage in in such such parts parts as as

is is needless needless to to say say that that a a girl girl like like
herself herself with with all all the the intensity intensity of of her her nature nature into into every every role role she she
played was was the the greatest greatest secret secret of of her her success for with with her
nature nature rose rose superior superior to to art the the other other hand it it fixed fixed her her dramatic dramatic
for for it it barred barred her her out out of of comedy melancholy morbid morbid
disposition disposition was was in in the the sympathy sympathy with with tragic tragic but but she she
failed failed when when she she tried tried to to represent represent the the lighter lighter moods moods and and the the merry merry
moments moments of of those those who who welcome welcome mirth could could counterfeit counterfeit despair and and
unforced unforced tears tears would would fill fill her her eyes but but she she could could not not laugh laugh and and romp romp
and and simulate simulate a a gaiety gaiety that that was was never never hers

would would have have been been delighted delighted to to act act at at one one of of the the in in
but but they they were were closed closed to to her her through through jealousy into into the the
in in the the eastern eastern part part of of and and for for ten ten years years she she was was a a
leading leading lady lady there there in in many many and and in in many many she she
blossomed blossomed into into womanhood womanhood there there came came into into her her life life the the love love which which was was to to
be be at at once once a a source source of of the the most most profound profound interest interest and and of of the the most most
intense intense agony

is is odd odd that that all all her her professional professional success success never never her her any any
happiness life life of of the the actress actress who who traveled traveled from from town town to to town the the
crude crude and and coarse coarse experiences experiences which which she she had had to to undergo the the disorder disorder and and
the the unsettled unsettled mode mode of of living all all produced produced in in her her a a profound profound disgust
was was of of too too exquisite exquisite a a fiber fiber to to live live in in such such a a way especially especially in in a a
century century when when the the of of existence existence were were for for the the very very few

speaks speaks herself herself of of obligatory the the insistence insistence of of men
and and of of love love affairs how how could could such such a a woman woman as as
keep keep herself herself from from love love affairs motion motion of of the the stage stage and and its its mimic mimic
satisfied satisfied her her only only while while she she was was actually actually upon upon the the boards
offered offered her her an an emotional emotional excitement excitement that that endured endured and and that that was was always always
changing was was the instinct instinct of of her her being and and she she once once
wrote could could one one do do in in the the world world without without loving

through through these these ten ten years years she she seems seems to to have have loved loved only only that that she she
might might be be unhappy was was a a strange strange twist twist in in her her mind who who were were
honorable honorable and and who who loved loved her her with with sincerity sincerity she she treated treated very very badly
who who were were indifferent indifferent or or ungrateful ungrateful or or actually actually base base she she to to
choose choose by by a a sort sort of of perverse perverse instinct the the explanation explanation of of it it is is
that that during during those those ten ten years though though she she had had many many lovers she she never never
really really loved sought sought excitement passion and and after after that that the the
mournfulness mournfulness which which comes comes when when passion passion dies one one man man after after another another
came came into into her her of of them them promising promising she she bore bore two two
children whose whose fathers fathers were were unknown or or at at least least uncertain after after
all one one can can scarcely scarcely pity pity her since since she she had had not not yet yet in in reality reality known known
that that great great passion passion which which comes comes but but once once in in life far far she she had had learned learned
only only a a sort sort of of feeble feeble cynicism which which she she expressed expressed in in letters letters and and in in
such such as as these

are are sweet sweet which which would would not not venture venture to to commit commit again
experiences all all too too sad have have served served to to illumine illumine my my reason

am am utterly utterly weary weary of of love love and and prodigiously prodigiously to to have have no no more more of of
it it for for the the rest rest of of my my life because after after all don't dont wish wish either either to to
die die or or to to go go mad

she she also also said know know too too well well that that no no one one dies dies of of grief

had had had indeed some some very very unfortunate unfortunate experiences of of rank rank had had
loved loved her her and and had had then then cast cast her her off actor one one would would have have
married married her but but she she would would not not accept accept his his offer magistrate magistrate in in
promised promised marriage and and then when when she she was was about about to to accept accept
him he he wrote wrote to to her her that that he he was was going going to to yield yield to to the the wishes wishes of of his his
family family and and make make a a more more advantageous advantageous alliance so so she she was was
alternately alternately caressed caressed and and mere mere plaything and and yet yet this this was was
probably probably all all that that she she really really needed needed at at the the to to stir stir her
something something to to make make her her mournful mournful or or indignant indignant or or ashamed

was was inevitable inevitable that that at at last last should should appear appear in in
had had won won such such renown renown throughout throughout the the that that even even those those
who who were were intensely intensely jealous jealous of of her her were were obliged obliged to to give give her her due due
consideration when when she she was was in in her her twenty-fifth year she she
became became a a member member of of the the she she made made an an immediate immediate
and and most most brilliant brilliant impression easily easily the the leading leading place
was was one one of of the the glories glories of of for for she she became became the the fashion fashion outside outside the the
theater the the first first time time the the great great classic classic plays plays were were given not not in in
the the monotonous monotonous singsong singsong which which had had become become a a sort sort of of theatrical theatrical
convention but but with with all all the the fire fire and and naturalness naturalness of of life

the the fashion elevated elevated the the social social rank rank of of
and and of of salon salon was was thronged thronged by by men men and and of of rank
wrote wrote in in her her honor be be invited invited to to her her dinners dinners was was
almost almost like like receiving receiving a a decoration decoration from from the the king ought ought to to have have
been been happy for for she she had had the the summit summit of of her her profession profession and and
something something more

still still she she was was unhappy all all her her letters letters one one finds finds a a plaintive plaintive
tone a a little little sound sound that that how how slightly slightly her her nature nature had had
been been changed longer however did did she she throw throw herself herself away away upon upon
or or
that that she she was was different different from from other other of of that that age
said said to to her her coarsely coarsely at at his his first first introduction

now me me lots lots of of wit wit and and lots lots of of love

remark remark was was characteristic characteristic of of the the time had had learned learned at at
least least one one thing and and that that was was the the discontent discontent which which came came from from light light
affairs had had thrown thrown herself herself away away too too often she she could could not not love love
with with her her entire entire being if if she she could could not not give give all all that that was was in in her her to to be be
given whether whether of of her her heart heart or or mind mind or or soul then then she she would would love love no no
more more at at all

this this time time there there came came to to a a man man remarkable remarkable in in his his own own century
and and one one who who became became almost almost a a hero hero of of romance was was
de de as as the the called called him his his name name and and
title title being being while while we we usually usually term term him in in
de de was was now in in entering entering his his
twenty-fifth year though though so so young his his career career had had been been a a
strange strange one and and it it was was destined destined to to be be still still more more remarkable was was
the the natural natural son son of of of of who who later later became became
of of and and who who is is known known in in history history as as the the

was was a a giant giant in in stature stature and and in in strength handsome daring
unscrupulous and and yet yet extremely extremely fascinating life life was was one one of of
revelry revelry and and fighting fighting and and display in in his his cups cups he he would would often often call call
for for a a horseshoe horseshoe and and twist twist it it into into a a knot knot with with his his powerful powerful fingers
were were his his but but the the one one for for whom whom he he the the most most was was a a
beautiful beautiful and and highspirited girl girl of of rank
was was from from a a rough rough old old who who in in
the the had had slashed slashed and and and and and and
to to his his hearts content him him to to have have
inherited inherited a a high high spirit spirit and and a a sort sort of of lawlessness lawlessness which which charmed charmed the the
stalwart stalwart of of

son de de inherited inherited everything everything that that was was good good in in his his
and and a a great great deal deal that that was was less less commendable a a mere mere child child of of
twelve twelve he he had had on on joining joining the the army army of of and and had had
seen seen rough rough service service in in a a very very strenuous strenuous campaign years years later later he he
such such daring daring on on the the battlefield that that him him
and and paid paid him him a a compliment compliment under under the the form form of of a a rebuke

man he he said you must must not not mistake mistake mere mere recklessness recklessness for for
valor

he he was was twenty twenty he he had had attained attained the the stature stature and and strength strength of of his his
royal royal father and to to prove prove it he he in in his his turn turn called called for for a a horseshoe
which which he he twisted twisted and and broke broke in in his his fingers on on the the side side of of the the
and and and and again again against against the the everywhere everywhere
high high courage courage and and also also genius genius as as a a commander for for he he never never lost lost his his
selfpossession amid amid the the very very danger but but possessed as as
vigilance foresight and and sagacious sagacious precaution

handsome was was a a master master of of all all the the arts arts that that
pleased with with just just a a touch touch of of roughness which which not not unfitting unfitting in in
so so gallant gallant a a soldier troops troops adored adored him him and and would would follow follow wherever wherever
he he might might choose choose to to lead lead them for for he he over over these these rude rude men men a a
magnetic magnetic power power resembling resembling that that of of in in after after years private private
life life he he was was a a hard hard drinker drinker and and fond fond of of every every form form of of pleasure
no no fortune fortune of of his his own a a marriage marriage was was arranged arranged for for him him with with the the
who who was was wealthy but but in in three three years years he he
had had squandered squandered all all her her money money upon upon his his pleasures and and had moreover
himself himself heavily heavily in in debt

was was at at this this time time that that he he first first came came to to to to study study military military
tactics had had hard hard against against the the in in the the that that were were
now now ended but but his his chivalrous chivalrous bearing his his handsome handsome person and and his his
joviality joviality made made him him at at once once a a universal universal favorite favorite in in
the the perfumed perfumed with with their their and and and and mincing mincing
ways de de came came as as a a sort sort of of knight knight of of daring
his his broken broken was was held held to to be be quite quite charming
and and to to see see him him break break a a horseshoe horseshoe with with his his fingers fingers every every one one into into
raptures

wonder then that that he he was was welcomed welcomed in in the the very very highest highest circles
at at once once he he the the notice notice of of the the de de a a
beautiful beautiful woman woman of of the the blood blood royal her her it it has has been been said said that that she she
was was the personification personification of of a a kiss the the incarnation incarnation of of an an embrace the the
ideal ideal of of a a dream dream of of love chestnut chestnut hair hair was was tinted tinted with with little little
of of gold eyes eyes were were violet violet black complexion complexion was was
dazzling by by the the kings orders orders she she had had been been forced forced to to marry marry a a
man man whose whose very very limbs limbs were were so so weakened weakened by by disease disease and and evil evil
living living that that they they would would often often fail fail to to support support him and and he he would would fall fall to to
the the ground a a screaming screaming mass mass of of flesh

is is not not surprising surprising that that his his lovely lovely wife wife should should have have much much at at
his his abuse abuse of of her her and and still still more more at at his his grotesque grotesque her her
eyes eyes fell fell on on de de she she saw saw in in him him one one who who could could free free her her from from
her her bondage a a trick trick he he led led the the de de to to invade invade
the the of of the the princess with with that that she she
was was not not alone charge charge proved proved quite quite untrue and and so so she she left left her her
husband having having won won the the sympathy sympathy of of her her own own world which which held held that that she she
had had been been it it was was not not she she who who was was destined destined to to win win and and hold hold
the the love love of of de de

long long after after his his appearance appearance in in the the capital capital he he was was invited invited to to
dine dine with with the the of of had had seen seen her her
on on the the stage her her previous previous history that that she she was was very very
much much of of a a soiled soiled dove but but when when he he met met her her these these two two natures so so
utterly utterly dissimilar together as as it it were through through the the
indescribable indescribable attraction attraction of of was was big big and and powerful she she was was
small small and and fragile was was merry and and full full of of quips quips and and jests she she was was
reserved reserved and and melancholy felt felt in in the the other other a a need need

one one of of their their the the climax climax came was was not not the the man man
to to hesitate while while she she already in in her her thoughts had had made made a a full full
surrender one one great great sweep sweep he he gathered gathered her her into into his his arms
to to her her as as if if no no man man had had ever ever laid laid his his hand hand upon upon her her until until that that
moment out

for for the the first first time time in in my my life seem seem to to live

was indeed the the very very first first love love which which in in her her checkered checkered career career was was
really really worthy worthy of of the the name had had supposed supposed that that all all such such things things were were
passed passed and and gone that that her her heart heart was was closed closed for for ever that that she she was was
invulnerable and and yet yet here here she she found found herself herself about about the the neck neck of of
this this impetuous impetuous soldier soldier and and showing showing him him all all the the shy shy fondness fondness and and the the
unselfish unselfish devotion devotion of of a a young young girl this this instant instant
never never loved loved another another man man and and never never even even at at any any other other
man man with with the the slightest slightest interest nine nine long long years years the the two two were were bound bound
together though though there there were were strange strange events events to to ruffle ruffle the the surface surface of of
their their love

de de had had been been by by a a king had had the the lofty lofty ambition ambition to to
be be a a king king himself and and he he felt felt the the of of that that genius genius which which in in
after after years years was was to to make make him him a a great great soldier and and to to win win the the brilliant brilliant
victory victory of of which which to to this this very very day day the the are are never never tired tired
of of had had made made him him a a marshal marshal of of and and a a
certain certain restlessness restlessness came came over over him loved loved yet yet he he felt felt that that
to to remain remain in in the the enjoyment enjoyment of of her her ought ought not not to to be be the the whole whole
of of a a mans career

the the of of that that time time a a vassal vassal state state of of
now now part part of of a a ruler de de was was eager eager
to to secure secure its its throne which which would would make make him him at at least least and and the the
chief chief of of a a principality thither thither and and found found that that money money was was
needed needed to to carry carry out out his his widow widow of of the the late late
niece niece of of the the and and later later of of
soon soon as as she she had had met met this this dazzling dazzling genius offered offered to to help help him him to to
acquire acquire the the duchy duchy if if he he would would only only marry marry her did did not not utterly utterly
refuse another another woman woman of of high high rank the the
of of the the daughter made made him him very very much much the the same same
proposal

of of these these imperial imperial might might well well have have a a man man like like
de de had had he he been been wholly wholly fancyfree for for the the second second of of them them
inherited inherited the the high high spirit spirit and and the the genius genius of of the the great great while while the the
first first was was a a princess resembling resembling some some of of those those
who who loved loved to to stoop stoop that that they they might might conquer is is described described
as as indolent indolent and and sensual and and she she once once declared declared that that the the chief chief good good in in
the the world world was was love though though she she neglected neglected affairs affairs of of state state and and
them them over over to to she she won won and and kept kept the the affections affections of of her her people
was was unquestionably unquestionably endowed endowed with with the the magnetic magnetic gift gift of of winning winning hearts

who who was was left left behind behind in in very very little little of of what what was was
going going on two two things things were were absolutely absolutely clear clear to to her was was that that if if
her her lover lover the the duchy duchy he he must must be be parted parted from from her other other was was
that that without without money money his his ambition ambition must must be be and and that that he he would would
then then return return to to her was was a a test test to to try try the the soul soul of of any any woman
proved proved the the height height and and the the depth depth of of her her devotion what what might
should should be be of of even even though though she she lost lost him
gathered gathered together together her her whole whole fortune sold sold every every jewel jewel that that she she
possessed and and sent sent her her lover lover the the sum sum of of nearly nearly a a million million

incident incident how how absolutely absolutely she she was was his in in fact because because of of
various various he he failed failed of of election election to to the the ducal ducal throne throne of of
and and he he to to with with all all her her money money spent and and
without without even even the the grace at at first to to show show his his gratitude and and
over over his his ill ill luck merely merely and and him though though she she
had had heard heard that that he he had had thought thought of of another another woman woman to to secure secure the the
dukedom one one of of her her letters letters she she out out with with the the pitiful pitiful
exclamation

am am distracted distracted with with rage rage and and anguish it it not not natural natural to to cry cry out out
against against such such treachery man man surely surely ought ought to to know know ought ought to to
love love me my my are are we

still still she she could could not not give give him him up nor nor could could he he give give her her up though though
there there were were frightful frightful scenes scenes between between when when he he cruelly cruelly
her her and and when when her her native native melancholy melancholy into into
of of despair there there occurred occurred an an incident incident which which is is more more or or less less

where where she she could could watch watch the the coming coming storm storm and and gloat gloat over over the the discomfiture discomfiture
of of her her rival

the the curtain curtain rose and and when when as as an an uproar uproar
was was clear clear to to the the great great actress actress that that a a plot plot had had been been devised devised
against against her an an instant instant her her whole whole soul soul was was afire

instinctive instinctive art art when when suddenly suddenly she she was was seized seized with with the the most most frightful frightful
pains anguish anguish was was obvious obvious to to every every one one who who saw saw her and and yet yet she she

is is not not surprising surprising that that his his people most most of of whom whom never never saw saw him were were
very very fond fond of of him and and did did not not know know that that he he was was selfish a a loose loose liver
and and almost almost a a vassal vassal of of the the king king of of

part part of of his his career career is is in in reality reality the the most most romantic romantic of of all was was
hunted hunted closely almost almost as as by by hounds he he had had only only such such sleep sleep
as as he he could could snatch snatch during during short short periods periods of of safety and and there there were were times times
when when his his came came within within an an inch inch of of him never never in in
his his life life were were his his spirits spirits so so high

was was a a sort sort of of life life that that he he had had never never seen seen before climbing climbing the the
mighty mighty rocks and and listening listening to to the the thunder thunder of of the the among among
which which he he often often with with only only one one faithful faithful follower follower to to guard guard him
story story of of his his escape escape is is almost almost incredible but but he he and and and and
rolled rolled upon upon the the grass grass when when he he was was free free from from care with with the the
most most with with whom whom he he the the smoky smoky brew brew of of
the the and and lived lived as as he he might might on on fish fish and and and and bacon bacon and and wild wild
fowl with with an an appetite appetite such such as as he he had had never never known known at at the the luxurious luxurious
court court of of or or

not not a a girl girl named named met met him caused caused him him to to be be
dressed dressed in in the the clothes clothes of of her her and and thus thus him him off off to to the the

for for a a time time it it was was impossible impossible to to follow follow him and and there there the the two two
lived lived almost almost alone alone together a a proximity proximity could could not not fail fail to to stir stir
the the romantic romantic feeling feeling of of one one who who was was both both a a youth youth and and a a prince the the
other other hand no no thought thought of of lovemaking seems seems to to have have entered entered

that that made made every every advance advance consistent consistent with with a a delicate delicate
remembrance remembrance of of her her sex sex and and services

victorious victorious troops troops and and in in a a swift swift galley galley from from in in pursuit pursuit

wonder wonder of of the the story story is is by by its its extraordinary extraordinary nature
men men in in private private life life have have lost lost fortune fortune and and fame fame for for the the love love of of woman

of of criticism the the world world for for nineteen nineteen hundred hundred years years been been
blinded blinded by by a a show show of of sentiment it it so so absolutely absolutely been been by by
those those who who lived lived and and wrote wrote in in the the days days which which closely closely on on the the
events events that that make make up up this this extraordinary extraordinary narrative

answering answering these these questions questions we we must must consider in in the the first first place
the the scene and in in the the second second place the the psychology psychology of of the the two two central central
who who for for so so long long a a time time have have been been as as the the very very
embodiment embodiment of of unchecked unchecked passion

successively successively captivated captivated two two of of the the greatest greatest men men whom whom had had ever ever seen
like like a a queen to to escape escape disgrace modern modern
may may have have to to say say concerning concerning small small details this this story story still still remains remains the the
love love story story of of which which the the world world has has any any record







a a woman amid amid the the of of passionate passionate and and languishing languishing love
has has out out in in a a sort sort of of ecstasy

love love you you as as no no woman woman ever ever loved loved a a man man before

she she this this she she it whole whole soul soul is is with with the the
ardor ardor of of emotion really really seems seems to to her her that that no no one one ever ever could could have have
loved loved so so much much as as she

untaught become become almost almost one one of of those those
of of amorous amorous expression expression which which belong belong to to the the vocabulary vocabulary
of of woman woman who who it when when torn torn by by the the almost almost
terrible terrible extravagance extravagance of of a a great great love that that no no one one before before her her
has has ever ever said said it and and that that in in her her own own case case it it is is absolutely absolutely true

how how many many are are really really faithful faithful to to the the end many indeed
if if circumstances circumstances admit admit of of easy easy faithfulness highsouled generous
ardent ardent nature nature will will endure endure an an infinity infinity of of of of misfortune
of of neglect and and even even of of ill ill treatment so the the flame though though it it
may may sink sink low can can be be revived revived again again to to burn burn as as as as before
in in order order that that this this may may be be so so it it is is necessary necessary that that the the object object of of such such a a
wonderful wonderful devotion devotion be be alive that that he he be be present present and and visible or if if
he he be be absent that that there there should should still still exist exist some some hope hope of of renewing renewing the the
exquisite exquisite intimacy intimacy of of the the past

man man who who is is sincerely sincerely loved loved may may be be compelled compelled to to take take long long journeys journeys
which which will will separate separate him him for for an an indefinite indefinite time time from from the the woman woman who who
has has given given her her heart heart to to him and and she she will will still still be be constant may may
be be imprisoned perhaps perhaps for for life yet yet there there is is always always the the hope hope of of his his
release release or or of of his his escape and and some some will will be be faithful faithful to to him him and and
will will watch watch for for his his return given given a a situation situation which which absolutely absolutely bars bars
out out hope which which two two souls souls in in such such a a way way that that they they can can never never be be
united united in in this this world and and there there we we have have a a test test so so terribly terribly severe severe that that
few few even even of of the the most most loyal loyal and and intensely intensely lovers lovers can can endure endure it

that that such such a a situation situation would would lead lead a a woman woman to to turn turn to to any any other other man man
than than the the one one to to whom whom she she had had given given her her very very life but but we we might might expect expect
that that at at least least her her strong strong desire desire would would cool cool and and weaken might might cherish cherish
his his memory memory among among the the precious precious of of her her love love life but but that that she she
should should still still pour pour out out the the same same rapturous unstinted unstinted passion passion as as before before
seems seems almost almost too too much much to to believe annals annals of of emotion emotion record record only only one one
such such instance and and so so this this instance instance has has become become known known to to all and and has has
been been cherished cherished for for nearly nearly a a thousand thousand years the the story story of of a a
woman woman who who did did love perhaps as as no no one one ever ever loved loved before before or or since for for
she she was was subjected subjected to to this this cruel cruel test and and she she met met the the test test not not alone alone
completely but but triumphantly triumphantly and and almost almost fiercely

story story is of of course the the story story of of and and has has many many
times times been been falsely falsely told of of it it have have been been omitted and and other other
of of it it have have been been garbled whole whole literature literature has has grown grown up up
around around the the subject may may well well be be worth worth our our while while to to clear clear away away the the
and and the the doubtful doubtful points and and once once more more to to tell tell it it simply
without without bias and and with with a a strict strict adherence adherence to to what what seems seems to to be be the the truth truth
attested attested by by authentic authentic records

is is one one circumstance circumstance connected connected with with the the story story which which we we must must
specially specially note narrative narrative does does something something more more than than set set forth forth the the one one
quite quite unimpeachable unimpeachable instance instance of of unconquered unconquered constancy how in in
the the last last analysis that that which which touches touches the the human human heart heart has has more more vitality vitality
and and more more enduring enduring interest interest than than what what the the intellect intellect or or those those
of of the the human human mind mind which which are are external external to to our our emotional emotional
nature

yet yet at at the the same same time time by by many many for for his his advocacy advocacy of of reason reason as as
against against blind blind faith the the years years of of his his wandering wandering he he came came to to have have
a a wide wide knowledge knowledge of of the the world world and and of of human human nature we we try try to to imagine imagine
him him as as he he was was in in his his year year we we shall shall find find in in him him a a remarkable remarkable
combination combination of of attractive attractive qualities

must must be be remembered remembered that that though in in a a sense he he was was an an ecclesiastic
he he had had not not yet yet been been ordained ordained to to the the priesthood but but was was rather rather a a
person person who who did did not not belong belong to to any any religious religious order though though he he was was
supposed supposed to to live live according according to to a a definite definite set set of of religious religious rules rules and and as as a a
member member of of a a religious religious community however made made rather rather light light
of of his his was was at at once once an an accomplished accomplished man man of of the the
world world and and a a profound profound scholar was was nothing nothing of of the the recluse recluse about about
him mingled mingled with with his his fellow fellow men whom whom he he dominated dominated by by the the charm charm of of
his his personality was was eloquent ardent and and persuasive could could turn turn
a a delicate delicate compliment compliment as as as as he he could could elaborate elaborate a a syllogism
rich rich voice voice had had in in it it a a seductive seductive quality quality which which was was never never without without its its
effect

and and well well formed he he possessed possessed as as much much vigor vigor of of body body as as of of mind
were were his his accomplishments accomplishments entirely entirely those those of of the the scholar wrote wrote
dainty dainty verses which which he he also also set set to to music and and which which he he sang sang himself himself
with with a a rare rare skill have have called called him him the first first of of the the
and and many many who who nothing nothing for for his his skill skill in in logic logic admired admired him him for for
his his gifts gifts as as a a musician musician and and a a poet he he was was one one to to attract attract
attention attention wherever wherever he he for for none none could could fail fail to to recognize recognize his his power

was was soon soon after after his his year year that that he he to to where where
he he was was welcomed welcomed by by much much tact tact he he reconciled reconciled himself himself to to
his his so so that that his his life life now now to to be be full full of of promise promise and and of of
sunshine

was was at at this this time time that that he he became became acquainted acquainted with with a a very very beautiful beautiful
young young girl girl named named was was only only eighteen eighteen years years of of age yet yet
already already she she possessed possessed not not only only beauty but but many many accomplishments accomplishments which which
were were then then quite quite rare rare in in since since she she both both wrote wrote and and spoke spoke a a number number
of of languages and like like was was a a lover lover of of music music and and poetry
was was the the illegitimate illegitimate daughter daughter of of a a canon canon of of patrician patrician blood so so
that that she she is is said said to to have have been been a a worthy worthy representative representative of of the the noble noble house house
of of the the throughout throughout history history for for chivalry chivalry and and
charm

to to this this time time we we do do not not know know precisely precisely what what sort sort of of life life
had had lived lived in in private declared declared that that he he had had squandered squandered his his
substance substance in in vicious vicious ways friends friends denied denied this and and represented represented
him him as as strict strict and and chaste truth truth probably probably lies lies between between these these two two
was was naturally naturally a a man man of of the the world who who may may
very very possibly possibly have have relieved relieved his his studies studies by by occasional occasional revelry revelry
and and light light love is is not not at at all all likely likely that that he he was was addicted addicted to to gross gross
passions passions and and low low

such such as as he he was when when he he first first saw saw he he conceived conceived for for her her
a a violent violent attachment guarded guarded in in the the house house of of her her uncle
it it was was difficult difficult at at first first for for to to meet meet her her save save in in the the
most most casual casual way yet yet every every time time that that he he heard heard her her exquisite exquisite voice voice and and
watched watched her her graceful graceful manners manners he he became became more more and and more more infatuated
studies studies suddenly suddenly tame tame and and colorless colorless beside beside the the fierce fierce scarlet scarlet
flame flame which which blazed blazed up up in in his his heart

it it was was because because of of these these studies studies and and of of his his great great
reputation reputation as as a a scholar scholar that that he he managed managed to to obtain obtain access access to to
her her uncle uncle and and made made a a chance chance proposal proposal that that he he should should himself himself
become become an an inmate inmate of of household household in in order order that that he he might might teach teach
this this girl girl of of so so much much promise an an offer offer coming coming from from so so brilliant brilliant a a
man man was was accepted

that that time time could could visit visit without without restraint was was
her her teacher and and the the two two spent spent hours hours together nominally nominally in in the the study study of of
and and but but doubtless doubtless very very little little was was said said between between them them
upon upon such such unattractive unattractive the the contrary with with all all his his wide wide
experience experience of of life his his eloquence his his perfect perfect manners and and his his
fascination put put forth forth his his power power to to captivate captivate the the senses senses of of
a a girl girl still still in in her her teens teens and and quite quite ignorant ignorant of of the the world
he he employed employed to to win win her her the the genius genius which which had had overwhelmed overwhelmed all all the the
great great of of learning learning in in the the world

was was then then that that the the pleasures pleasures of of knowledge the the joys joys of of thought the the
of of eloquence were were all all called called into into play play to to charm charm and and move move and and
plunge plunge into into a a profound profound and and strange strange intoxication intoxication this this noble noble and and tender tender
heart heart which which had had never never known known either either love love or or sorrow can can imagine imagine
that that everything everything helped helped on on the the inevitable inevitable end studies studies them them
to to see see each each other other freely and and also also permitted permitted them them to to be be
alone alone together their their books books lay lay open open between between them but but either either long long
periods periods of of silence silence their their reading or or else else words words of of deepening deepening
intimacy intimacy made made them them forget forget their their studies studies altogether eyes eyes of of the the two two
lovers lovers turned turned from from the the book book to to mingle mingle their their glances and and then then to to turn turn
away away in in a a confusion confusion that that was was conscious

would would touch touch hand apparently apparently by by accident and and when when conversation conversation
would would often often hear hear the the long quivering quivering sigh sigh which which
the the strange and and yet yet exquisite exquisite joy joy which which
experienced

was was not not long long before before the the heart heart had had been been wholly wholly won
by by her her emotion she she met met the the of of her her lover lover with with those those as as
unrestrained unrestrained as as his very very innocence innocence deprived deprived her her of of the the protection protection
which which older older would would have have had was was given given freely and and even even
wildly by by and and all all was was taken taken by by who who himself himself
declared

pleasure pleasure of of teaching teaching her her to to love love the the delightful delightful fragrance fragrance
of of all all the the perfumes perfumes in in the the world

these these two two could could not not always always live live in in a a paradise paradise which which was was entirely entirely
their their own world world of of notice notice of of their their close close association
written written to to by by as as if if in in letters letters of of fire were were
found found and and shown shown to to who until until this this time had had suspected suspected nothing
he he ordered ordered to to leave leave his his house his his niece niece to to
see see her her lover lover any any more

the the two two could could not not be be separated and indeed there there was was good good reason reason
why why they they should should still still cling cling together left left her her uncles
house house and and fled fled through through the the narrow narrow of of to to the the dwelling dwelling of of
sister where where himself himself was was living
presently the the young young girl girl birth birth to to a a son who who was was named named
after after an an instrument instrument used used by by since since both both the the father father and and
the the mother mother felt felt that that the the offspring offspring of of so so great great a a love love should should have have no no
ordinary ordinary name

was was furious and and rightly rightly so hospitality hospitality had had been been
and and his his niece niece dishonored that that the the pair pair should should at at once once
be be married was was revealed revealed a a certain certain weakness weakness in in the the character character of of
to to the the marriage but but that that it it should should be be
kept kept an an utter utter secret

enough it it was was herself herself who who to to becoming becoming the the wife wife
of of the the man man she she loved could could go go no no farther saw saw that
were were he he to to marry marry her his his advancement advancement in in the the would would be be almost almost
impossible for while while the the very very minor minor clergy clergy sometimes sometimes married married in in spite spite
of of the the papal papal bulls matrimony matrimony was was becoming becoming a a fatal fatal bar bar to to ecclesiastical ecclesiastical
promotion so so pitifully both both with with her her uncle uncle and and
with with that that there there should should be be no no marriage would would rather rather bear bear
all all manner manner of of disgrace disgrace than than stand stand in in the the way way of of advancement

has has himself himself given given some some of of the the words words in in which which she she with with him

glory glory shall shall win win from from you when when have have made made you you quite quite inglorious inglorious
and and have have humbled humbled both both of of us vengeance vengeance will will the the world world inflict inflict on on
me me if if deprive deprive it it of of one one so so brilliant curses curses will will follow follow such such a a
marriage outrageous outrageous would would it it be be that that you whom whom nature nature created created for for
the the universal universal good should should be be devoted devoted to to one one woman woman and and plunged plunged into into such such
disgrace loathe loathe the the thought thought of of a a marriage marriage which which would would humiliate humiliate you

every every possible possible effort effort which which another another woman woman in in her her place place would would
employ employ to to make make him him marry marry her her she she used used in in order order to to dissuade dissuade him
her her sweet sweet face face streaming streaming with with tears she she uttered uttered that that tremendous tremendous
sentence sentence which which makes makes one one really really think think that that she she loved loved him him as as no no other other
woman woman ever ever loved loved a a man out in in an an agony agony of of selfsacrifice

would would rather rather be be your your mistress mistress than than the the wife wife even even of of an an emperor

the the two two were were married and and to to his his
and and to to his his studies months months they they met met but but seldom
however the the and and directed directed against against
so so that that he he broke broke his his promise promise of of secrecy and and told told his his
friends friends that that and and were were man man and and wife to to
for for confirmation more more she she in in an an extraordinary extraordinary way way the the depth depth
of of her her devotion

am am no no wife she she said is is not not true true that that has has married married me
uncle uncle merely merely you you this this to to save save my my reputation

asked asked her her whether whether she she would would swear swear to to this and without without a a moments
hesitation this this pure pure and and noble noble woman woman an an oath oath upon upon the the
that that there there had had been been no no marriage

was was by by this and furthermore
he he to to visit visit her girl therefore again again left left her her
uncles house house and and herself herself to to a a convent convent just just outside outside of of
where where she she assumed assumed the the habit habit of of a a nun nun as as a a disguise
continued continued from from time time to to time time to to meet meet her

heard heard of of this this he he put put his his own own interpretation interpretation on on it
believed believed that that intended intended to to ignore ignore the the marriage marriage altogether and and
that that possibly possibly he he might might even even marry marry some some other other woman any any case he he now now
hated hated with with all all his his heart and and he he resolved resolved to to take take a a fearful fearful and and
unnatural unnatural vengeance vengeance which which would would at at once once prevent prevent his his enemy enemy from from making making
any any other other marriage while while at at the the same same time time it it would would debar debar him him from from
ecclesiastical ecclesiastical preferment

carry carry out out his his plot plot first first a a man man who who was was the the
of of at at the the door door of of his his room room each each night
he he hired hired the the services services of of four four had had retired retired
and and was was deep deep in in slumber slumber the the treacherous treacherous valet valet unbarred unbarred the the door
of of entered entered and and fell fell upon upon the the sleeping sleeping man of of

the the most most shameful shameful mutilation mutilation that that is is possible
the the lights the the away away and and were were lost lost in in darkness leaving leaving
behind behind their their victim victim bound bound to to his his couch of of torment torment and and
bathed bathed in in his his own own blood

is is a a shocking shocking story and and yet yet it it is is intensely intensely characteristic characteristic of of the the
lawless lawless and and barbarous barbarous era era in in which which it it the the next next morning morning
the the news news through through city city like like a a beehive
and and and and into into the the street street and and
surrounded surrounded the the house house of of

the the entire entire city as as by by
toward toward his his house as as if if each each one one had had lost lost her her
husband

though though he he was still still retained retained enough enough of of the the spirit spirit of of
his his time time to to seek seek vengeance in in his his turn employed employed whom whom he he
set set upon upon the the track track of of those those who who had had assaulted assaulted him treacherous treacherous valet valet
and and one one of of were were run run down seized and and mutilated mutilated
precisely precisely as as had had been and and their their eyes eyes were were blinded third third was was
in in prison himself himself was was accused accused before before one one of of the the
courts which which alone alone had had power power to to punish punish an an ecclesiastic and and all all his his
goods goods were were

meantime how how did did it it fare fare with with grief grief was was greater greater than than
his his own while while her her love love and and her her devotion devotion were were absolutely absolutely undiminished
now now a a indeed a a beyond beyond
any any that that he he had had before before could could no no more more be be his his wife
made made it it plain plain that that he he put put no no trust trust in in her her fidelity was was unwilling unwilling
that that she she should should live live in in the the world world while while he he could could not and and so so he he told told
her her sternly sternly that that she she must must take take the the veil veil and and bury bury herself herself for for ever ever in in a a
nunnery

pain pain and and shame shame which which she she experienced experienced at at this this came came wholly wholly from from the the
fact fact that that did did not not trust trust her she she wrote

knows knows should should not not have have at at your your command to to precede precede or or to to
follow follow you you to to hell hell itself

was was his his distrust distrust that that cut cut her her to to the the heart her her love love for for him him
was was so so intense intense that that she she obeyed obeyed his his order after after she she the the vows
and and in in the the convent convent chapel shaken shaken with with she she before before the the altar altar
and and assumed assumed the the veil veil of of a a cloistered cloistered nun himself himself put put on on the the
black black tunic tunic of of a a monk monk and and entered entered the the of of

is is unnecessary unnecessary here here to to follow follow out out all all the the details details of of the the lives lives of of
and and after after this this scene
passed passed through through many many years years of of strife strife and and disappointment and and even even of of
humiliation for for on on one one occasion just just as as he he had had silenced silenced
de de so so he he himself himself was was silenced silenced and and put put to to rout rout by by of of
frail tense absorbed dominant dominant little little man whose whose face face
was was white white and and worn worn with with suffering but but in in whose whose eyes eyes there there was was a a
light light of of supreme supreme strength represented represented pure pure faith as as
represented represented pure pure reason and and the the two two men men met met before before a a great great council council to to
match match their their respective respective powers

with with fiery fiery eloquence brought brought a a charge charge of of heresy heresy against against
in in an an oration oration which which was was like like a a charge charge of of cavalry he he had had
rose rose with with an an ashen ashen face out out a a few few words
and and sat sat down was was condemned condemned by by the the council and and his his works works were were
ordered ordered to to be be burned

his his later later life life was was one one of of misfortune of of humiliation and and even even of of
personal personal danger whom whom he he tried tried to to rule rule rose rose fiercely fiercely
against against him life life was was threatened himself himself to to a a desolate desolate
and and lonely lonely place where where he he built built for for himself himself a a hut hut of of and and
hoping hoping to to spend spend his his final final years years in in meditation there there were were many many who who
had had not not forgotten forgotten his his ability ability as as a a teacher by by hundreds hundreds
to to the the desert desert place place where where he he abode hut hut was was surrounded surrounded by by tents tents and and
rude rude built built by by his his for for their their shelter

this this time time no no word word had had passed passed between between him him and and presently presently
wrote wrote and and to to the the world world a a curious curious and and exceedingly exceedingly frank frank
book which which he he called called of of copy copy of of it it

series series of of letters letters which which have have unique unique in in the the literature literature of of love

years years had had passed and and yet yet the the heart heart was was as as faithful faithful and and as as
full full of of yearning yearning as as on on the the day day when when the the two two had had parted has has been been
said said that that the the letters letters are are not not genuine and and they they must must be be read read with with this this
assertion assertion in in mind yet yet it it is is difficult difficult to to believe believe that that any any one one save save
herself herself could could have have a a human human soul soul into into such such
passionate passionate or or that that any any imitator imitator could could have have done done the the work

her her first first letter which which was was sent sent to to written written upon upon parchment
she she said

only only too too well well that that not not in in this this life life could could there there be be
anything anything save save spiritual spiritual love love between between himself himself and and wrote wrote to to

matters matters of of theology theology and and ethics but but he he never never one one word word to to feed feed
the the flame flame that that is is consuming consuming her woman woman understood understood at at last and and by by
degrees degrees her her letters letters became became as as calm calm as as however with with a a
tenderness tenderness and and feeling feeling which which that that in in her her heart heart of of hearts hearts she she was was

has has many many romantic romantic to to tell tell of of the the part part which which
have have played played in in the the of of nations it it is is
a a beauty beauty that that causes causes the the shifting shifting of of a a province it it is is
another another rich rich possessions possessions that that incite incite invasion invasion and and lead lead to to bloody bloody
or or or or the the refusal refusal of of marriages marriages and and the the lack lack
of of inheritance inheritance through through an an heiress the the failure failure of of a a male male
these these and and in in many many other other ways ways have have set set their their mark mark
indelibly indelibly upon upon the the trend trend of of history

if if we we look look over over these these different different events events we we shall shall find find that that it it
is is not not so so much much the the mere mere longing longing for for a a desire desire to to have have her her as as a a
has has seriously seriously affected affected the the annals annals of of any any nation like like
ordinary ordinary men have have paid paid their their suit suit and and then then have have away away
yet yet not not seriously seriously dejected royal royal marriages marriages are are made made either either to to
secure secure the the succession succession to to a a throne throne by by a a legitimate legitimate line line of of heirs heirs or or else else

some some sheltered sheltered bower bower remote remote from from courts courts than than in in the the and and
where where their their own own wives wives and and children children have have been been
with with all all the the appurtenances appurtenances of of legitimacy

are are not not many many that that hang hang persistently persistently about about the the lovemaking
of of a a single single woman the the case case of of one one or or another another we we may may find find an an episode episode
or or dashing something something spirited spirited or or striking something something
brilliant brilliant and and exhilarating or or something something sad for for a a whole whole
life life to to be be spent spent in in courtship courtship that that meant meant nothing nothing and and that that was was only only a a
clever clever aid aid to to is is surely surely an an unusual unusual and and really really wonderful wonderful
thing

is is the the more more unusual unusual because because the the woman woman herself herself was was not not intended intended by by
nature nature to to be be wasted wasted upon upon the the cold cold and and cheerless cheerless sport sport of of chancellors chancellors
and and and and men men who who had had no no thought thought of of her her except except to to use use her her as as
a a pawn was was hotblooded from from a a fiery fiery race and and one one whose whose
temper temper was was quick quick to to leap leap into into the the passion passion of of a a man

this this phase phase of of the the long long and and interesting interesting life life of of of of
we we must must notice notice several several important important facts the the first first place
she she herself above above all all else to to the the maintenance maintenance of of an an
that that would would be be half half or or half half or or even even partly partly
and and but but the the of of that that was was
one one and and undivided with with its its growing growing freedom freedom of of thought its its and and
bills its its nutbrown ale its its sturdy sturdy yeomen and and its its loyalty loyalty to to crown crown
and and once once said almost almost as as in in an an agony

love love more more than than anything

one one may may really really hold hold that that this this was was true

she she and and planned she she up up many many of of her her
royal royal rights she she into into of of treachery
she she left left herself herself on on record record as as an an arrant arrant liar false perjured
yet yet successful and and because because of of her her success success for for sake sake her her
will will hold hold her her in in high high remembrance since since her her and and her her
falsehood falsehood are are the the that that one one pardons pardons most most readily readily in in a a woman

the the second second place it it must must be be remembered remembered that that
and and pretended pretended were were almost almost always always a a part part of of her her diplomacy
not not a a part part of of her her diplomacy diplomacy they they were were a a mere mere appendage appendage to to her her
vanity seem seem to to be be the the flower flower of of the the people and and to to be be
surrounded surrounded by by the the noblest the the and and the the most most handsome handsome
not not only only of of her her own own kingdom but but of of was indeed a a choice choice
morsel morsel of of which which she she was was fond fond of of tasting even even though though it it meant meant nothing nothing
beyond beyond the the moment

though though at at times times she she could could be be very very cold and and though though she she made made
herself herself still still in in order order that that she she might might play play fast fast and and loose loose with with
foreign foreign who who played played fast fast and and loose loose with with of of
the the brother brother of of the the king with with an an
archduke with with a a magnificent magnificent barbarian barbarian prince prince of of with with of of
or or any any other other felt felt a a need need for for
some some nearer nearer and and more more tender tender association association to to which which she she might might give give
play play and and in in which which she she might might feel feel those those without without the the
danger danger that that when when love love is is mingled mingled with with diplomacy

us us first first consider consider a a picture picture of of the the woman woman as as she she really really was was in in order order
that that we we may may understand understand her her triple triple mistress mistress of of every every
art art that that know and and using using at at every every moment moment her her person person as as a a lure
a a vainglorious queen queen who who to to be be the the prey prey of of boundless boundless vanity
and a a woman woman who who had had all all a a passion and and who who could could cast cast
suddenly suddenly aside aside the the check check and and balance balance which which restrained restrained her her before before the the
public public gaze gaze and and could could allow allow herself herself to to give give full full play play to to the the emotion emotion
that that she she inherited inherited from from the the king her her father who who was was himself himself a a marvel marvel
of of fire fire and and impetuosity the the daughter daughter of of and and
should should be be a a gentle timid timid maiden maiden would would be be to to make make heredity heredity a a
farce

was was about about twenty-five twentyfive years years of of age age when when she she the the
throne throne of of is is odd odd that that the the date date of of her her birth birth cannot cannot be be given given
with with precision and and of of the the court
and and the the fact fact that that she she was was a a princess made made her her birth birth a a matter matter of of less less
account account than than if if there there had had been been no no male male heir heir to to the the throne any any rate
when when she she it after after the the deaths deaths of of her her brother
and and her her sister she she was was a a woman woman well well trained trained both both in in
intellect intellect and and in in physical physical development

who who loves loves to to dwell dwell upon upon the the later later years years of of
speaks speaks rather rather bitterly bitterly of of her her as as a a painted old old harridan
and and such such she she may may well well have have when at at nearly nearly seventy seventy years years of of age
she she and and a a sort sort of of skeleton skeleton smile smile at at the the handsome handsome young young
who who pretended pretended to to see see in in her her the the queen queen of of beauty beauty and and to to be be
dying dying for for love love of of her

in in her her earlier earlier years when when she she was was young young and and strong strong and and impetuous
she she deserved deserved far far different different words words than than these portrait portrait of of her her by by
which which now now hangs hangs in in her her when when she she must must
have have been been of of more more than than middle middle age and and still still the the face face is is one one of of beauty
though though it it be be a a strange strange and and almost almost artificial artificial that that
and perhaps you you on on against against your your will

is is interesting interesting to to compare compare this this painting painting with with the the frank frank
of of a a certain certain agent agent who who was was sent sent to to by by his his emperor and and
who who seems seems to to have have been been greatly greatly fascinated fascinated by by was was at at
that that time time in in the the prime prime of of her her beauty beauty and and her her power complexion complexion was was
of of that that peculiar peculiar transparency transparency which which is is seen seen only only in in the the face face of of golden golden
figure figure was was fine fine and and graceful and and her her wit wit an an accomplishment accomplishment
that that would would have have made made a a woman woman of of any any rank rank or or time time remarkable
envoy envoy

lives lives a a life life of of such such magnificence magnificence and and feasting feasting as as can can hardly hardly be be
imagined and and a a great great portion portion of of her her time time with with balls
hunting and and similar similar with with the the utmost utmost possible possible display but but
nevertheless nevertheless she she upon upon far far greater greater respect respect being being shown shown her her than than
was was by by summons summons but but lets lets them them know know
that that her her orders orders must must be be obeyed obeyed in in any any case

any any one one will will look look at at the the painting painting by by he he will will see see how how much much is is
made made of of distinctive distinctive feature feature quite quite as as noble noble with with the the
as as is is the the lip among among the the descendants descendants of of the the house house of of
were were and and were were very very long long and and white and and she she
at at them them and and played played with with them them a a great great deal and indeed
they they justified justified the the admiration admiration with with which which they they were were by by her her


was was the the personal personal appearance appearance of of a a young young girl we we
have have still still more more favorable favorable opinions opinions of of her her that that were were written written by by those those who who
had had occasion occasion to to be be near near her only only do do they they record record swift swift of of
her her person but but sometimes sometimes in in a a word word or or two two they they give give an an insight insight into into
certain certain traits traits of of mind mind which which came came out out prominently prominently in in her her later later years

may perhaps be be well well to to view view her her as as a a woman woman before before we we regard regard her her
more more fully fully as as a a queen has has been been said said that that inherited inherited many many
of of the the traits traits of of her her boldness boldness of of spirit the the rapidity rapidity of of
decision and at at the the same same time the the craft craft which which often often
itself itself when when it it was was least least expected

had had also as as is is well well known a a love love of of the the other other sex which which has has
made made his his reign reign memorable yet yet it it must must be be noted noted that that while while he he loved loved
much it it was was not not loose loose love a a king king of of from from to to
has has offended offended far far more more than than loved
he he married and and it it was was the the unfortunate unfortunate result result of of these these royal royal marriages marriages
that that has has made made him him seem seem unduly unduly fond fond of of however we we examine examine
each each one one of of the the separate separate espousals espousals we we shall shall find find that that he he did did not not enter enter
into into it it lightly and and that that he he broke broke it it off off unwillingly ardent ardent
temperament therefore was was checked checked by by a a certain certain rational rational or or
conventional conventional propriety so so that that he he was was by by no no means means a a loose loose liver as as
many many would would make make him him out out to to be

must must remember remember this this when when we we recall recall the the that that have have been been made made
against against and and the the strange strange that that were were told told of of her her
no no means means seemly seemly she she used used to to play play with with her her
guardian she she with with him him in in her her
were were made made the the subject subject of of an an official official inquiry yet yet it it came came
out out that that while while was was less less than than sixteen and and was was very very
much much her her senior his his wife wife was was with with him him on on his his visits visits to to the the chamber chamber of of
the the princess

and and his his wife wife were were also also sent sent to to question question her
had had a a keen keen mind mind and and one one well well trained trained to to cope cope with with any any others
wit wit in in this this sort sort of of crossexamination was was only only a a girl girl of of
fifteen yet yet she she was was a a match match for for the the accomplished accomplished courtier courtier in in diplomacy diplomacy
and and quick quick retort was was sent sent down down to to worm worm out out of of her her everything everything that that
she she and and flattery flattery and and forged forged letters letters and and false false confessions confessions
were were tried tried on on her but but they they were were tried tried in in vain would would tell tell nothing nothing
of of importance denied denied everything she she she she
herself herself of of a a favorite favorite defense defense in in suddenly suddenly attacking attacking those those who who
had had her brought brought counter counter against against and and put put
her her on on their their own own defense a a compromising compromising word word could could they they
wring wring out out of of her

bitterly bitterly of of the the imprisonment imprisonment of of her her governess
and and out

have have not not so so behaved behaved that that you you need need put put more more upon upon me

she she was was too too much much for for and and he he was was wise wise enough enough to to
recognize recognize her her cleverness

hath hath a a very very good good wit said said he and nothing nothing is is to to be be
of of her her except except by by great great policy he he added had had to to say say
my my fancy think think it it more more meet meet that that she she should should have have two two than than
one

notes notes the the fact fact that that after after the the two two of of the the princess princess had had
been been and and had had told told nothing nothing very very serious serious they they found found that that they they
had had been been wise wise in in remaining remaining friends friends of of the the royal royal girl sooner sooner had had
become become queen queen than than she she the the man man and and made made him him
treasurer treasurer of of the the household while while the the governess was was
treated treated with with great great consideration very very naturally
had had probably probably kept kept back back far far more more than than they they told

believed believed that that there there was was a a secret secret compact compact between between them for for
he he said quaintly all all sing sing one one song and and she she hath hath set set the the note note
for for them

after after this this her her brother brother death death brought brought to to the the throne throne her her
elder elder sister who who has has harshly harshly become become known known as as
this this time time put put aside aside her her boldness and and became became apparently apparently a a shy shy
and and simple-minded simpleminded virgin on on every every side side by by those those who who sought sought
to to trap trap her there there was was nothing nothing in in her her bearing bearing to to make make her her seem seem the the head head
of of a a party party or or the the young young chief chief of of a a faction could could exceed exceed her her in in
meekness spoke spoke of of her her sister sister in in the the terms
no no signs signs of of the the animation animation that that was was in in reality reality so so strong strong a a part part of of
her her character

coming coming to to the the throne she she away away her her modesty modesty and and and and
with with very very little little selfrestraint people people as as a a whole whole found found
little little fault fault with with her them them of of her her father the the bluff bluff
and and even even those those who who her her did did so so only only partially
thought thought much much better better of of her her than than they they had had of of her her saturnine saturnine sister the the
first first

life life of of has has been been very very misunderstood not not so so much much for for
the the facts facts in in it it as as for for the the manner manner in in which which these these have have been been arranged arranged and and
the the relation relation which which they they have have to to one one another ought ought to to recollect recollect that that
this this woman woman did did not not live live in in a a restricted restricted sphere that that her her life life was was not not
a a short short one and and that that it it was was crowded crowded with with and and full full of of vivid vivid
color think think of of her her as as living living for for a a short short period period of of time time and and speak speak
of of the the great great historical historical who who surrounded surrounded her her as as belonging belonging to to a a
single single epoch them them she she has has one one set set of of all all the the
the the of of brother the the of of the the
russian russian potentate the the archduke archduke sending sending her her sweet sweet from from
the the melancholy melancholy of of together together with with a a number number of of her her
own own brilliant brilliant
the the of of and and

course as as a a matter matter of of fact lived lived for for nearly nearly seventy seventy
of of a a in in that that long long time time there there
came came and and both both men men and and those those whom whom she she had had used used and and cast cast
aside with with others others whom whom she she had had also also treated treated with with gratitude and and who who had had
gladly gladly serving serving her through through it it all all there there was was a a continual continual change change
in in her her environment though though not not in in her young young soldier soldier to to the the
battlefield and and the the wise wise counselor counselor her her his his advice and and
she she either either it it or or nothing nothing for for it herself herself was was a a curious curious
blending blending of of forwardness forwardness and and folly of of wisdom wisdom and and of of
frivolity frivolity and and unbridled unbridled fancy through through it it all all she she loved loved her her people
even even though though she she often often them them and and made made them them pay pay her her taxes taxes in in the the
harsh harsh old old way way that that before before there there was was any any right right save save the the kings
will

the the same same time this this was was only only by by fits fits and and starts and and on on the the whole whole
she she served served them them well to to most most of of them them she she was was always always the the good good
it it to to the the and and yeoman far far from from the the
court that that the the queen queen was was said said to to dance dance in in her her and and to to swear swear
like like a a trooper

was indeed largely largely from from these these rustic rustic sources sources that that such such were were
scattered scattered throughout throughout thought thought them them picturesque
to to the the point point with with them them were were peace peace and and prosperity prosperity throughout throughout the the country
the the fact fact that that law law was was with with honesty honesty and and justice and and that that
was was safe safe from from her her deadly deadly swarthy swarthy and and the the


as as said we we must must remember remember always always that that the the of of one one period period
was was not not the the of of another and and that that the the of of one one period period
was was not not the the of of another one one thinks thinks of of it there there is is something something
wonderful wonderful in in the the almost almost starlike way way in in which which this this girl girl
unharmed unharmed through through a a thousand thousand own own were were at at first first
divided divided against against her a a score score of of greedy avaricious avaricious sought sought her her
destruction or or at at least least her her hand hand to to lead lead her her to to destruction all all the the
great great powers powers of of the the were were either either demanding demanding an an alliance alliance with with
or or threatening threatening to to dash dash down down amid amid their their own own

had had this this girl girl to to play play off off against against such such an an undaunted undaunted
spirit a a mind mind that that no no and and finally finally her her own own
person person and and the the fact fact that that she she was was a a woman and therefore might might give give
herself herself in in marriage marriage and and become become the the mother mother of of a a race race of of kings

was was this this last last weapon the the weapon weapon of of her her sex that that proved perhaps
the the most most powerful powerful of of all promising promising a a marriage marriage or or by by denying denying it or or
by by neither neither promising promising nor nor denying denying but but withholding withholding it she she forth forth a a
thousand thousand wily wily which which kept kept those those who who surrounded surrounded her her at at bay bay
until until she she had had made made still still another another deft deft and and combination
like like some some startled startled creature creature to to a a new new place place of of safety

when when she she was was fifty fifty years years of of age she she had had a a point point when when
her her and and her her pretended pretended lovemaking were were no no longer longer necessary
had had played played against against and and against against and and the the
archduke archduke against against the the others and and many many in in her her own own land land
against against the the different different which which they they headed might might have have sat sat
herself herself down down to to rest for for she she could could feel feel that that her her wisdom wisdom had had led led her her
up up into into a a high high place whence whence she she might might look look down down in in peace peace and and with with
assurance assurance of of the the tranquillity tranquillity that that she she had had won yet yet had had the the great great
rolled rolled and and toward toward the the she she was was
certain certain that that her her land land was was secure compact and and safe

remains remains to to see see what what were were those those amatory amatory relations relations which which she she may may be be
said said to to have have sincerely sincerely held had had played played at at lovemaking with with foreign foreign
because because it it was was wise wise and for for the the moment best had had played played
with with of of rank rank who who to to her her hand because because in in that that way way she she
might might conciliate at at one one time time her her and and at at another another her her
what what of of the the real real and and inward inward feeling feeling of of her her heart when when she she
was was not not thinking thinking of of political political or or the the necessities necessities of of state

is is an an interesting interesting question may may at at least least seek seek the the answer
hoping hoping thereby thereby to to solve solve one one of of the the most most interesting interesting phases phases of of this this
perplexing perplexing and and most most remarkable remarkable woman

must must be be remembered remembered that that it it was was not not a a question question of of whether whether
desired desired marriage may may have have done done so so as as a a brilliant brilliant stroke stroke
of of policy this this sense sense she she may may have have wished wished to to marry marry one one of of the the two two
who who were were among among her her even even here here she she
and and her her disapproved for for by by this this time time had had become become
largely largely had had she she married married a a prince prince and and had had
children might might have have become become an an appanage appanage of of

is is no no particular particular evidence evidence that that she she had had any any feeling feeling at at all all for for her her
or or while while the the pretensions pretensions
were were the the laughingstock of of the the court we we may may set set aside aside this this
question question of of marriage marriage as as having having nothing nothing to to do do with with her her emotional emotional life
did did desire desire a a son as as was was shown shown by by her her passionate passionate outcry outcry when when she she
compared compared herself herself with with of of

of of has has a a bonny bonny son while while am am but but a a barren barren stock

was was too too wise wise to to wed wed a a subject though had had she she married married at at all her her
choice choice would would doubtless doubtless have have been been an an this this respect as as in in
so so many many others she she was was like like her her father who who chose chose his his numerous numerous wives
with with the the exception exception of of the the first from from among among the the of of
the the court just just as as the the showy showy was was happy happy in in
what what a a king king may may do do is is by by no no means means so so easy easy for for
a a queen and and a a husband husband is is almost almost certain certain to to assume assume an an authority authority which which
makes makes him him unpopular unpopular with with the the of of his his wife

as as said said above we we must must consider consider not not so so much much whom whom she she would would have have
liked liked to to marry but but rather rather to to whom whom her her love love out out spontaneously and and
not not as as a a part part of of that that amatory amatory play play which which amused amused her her from from the the time time when when
she she with with down down to to the the very very last last days when when she she could could no no
longer longer move move about but but when when she she still still dabbled dabbled her her cheeks cheeks with with rouge rouge and and
powder powder and and set set her her skeleton skeleton face face amid amid a a forest forest of of

were were many many whom whom she she for for after after a a fashion would would not not let let
visit visit her her because because she she could could not not
bear bear to to have have him him so so long long away away from from her had had great great moments moments of of passion passion
for for the the of of though though in in the the end end she she signed signed his his
because because he he was was as as dominant dominant in in spirit spirit as as the the queen queen herself

of of wonderfully wonderfully picturesque picturesque novel
will will note note how how he he the the strongest strongest light light upon upon affection affection
for for of of historical historical instinct instinct is is
united united here here with with a a vein vein of of psychology psychology which which goes goes than than is is usual usual
with with him see see trying trying hard hard to to share share her her favor favor equally equally
between between two two but but the the of of fails fails to to please please her her because because he he
those those exquisite exquisite manners manners which which made made so so great great a a favorite favorite
with with the the fastidious fastidious queen

too the the story story of of marriage marriage with with is is
something something more more than than a a myth based based upon upon an an obscure obscure legend legend and and an an ancient ancient
ballad earl earl had had had had such such a a wife and and there there were were sinister sinister
about about the the manner manner of of her her death it it is is who who the the
and and the the bulldog bulldog just just as as he he brought brought
the the whole whole episode episode into into the the foreground foreground and and made made it it occur occur at at a a period period much much
later later than than was was historically historically true he he was was imbued imbued
with with the the spirit spirit and and knowledge knowledge of of that that strong strong conviction conviction that that
loved loved as as she she really really loved loved no no one one else

is is one one interesting interesting fact fact which which goes goes far far to to convince convince us as as
her her father father was in in a a way polygamous so so was was even even more more truly truly
polyandrous was was inevitable inevitable that that she she should should surround surround herself herself with with
attractive attractive men whose whose she she would would caress caress and and whose whose
she she would would accept the the outward outward eye eye there there was was very very little little
difference difference in in her her treatment treatment of of the the handsome handsome and and daring daring of of her her
court yet yet a a historian historian of of her her time time makes makes one one very very shrewd shrewd remark remark when when
he he every every one one she she some some power power at at all all save save


and and in in counsel counsel and and and and in in the the field field might might
have have their their own own way way at at times and and even even share share the the power but but
to to she she no no high high and and no no important important mission
so because because she she loved loved him him more more than than any any of of the the rest and
knowing knowing this she she that that if if besides besides her her love love she she granted granted him him any any
measure measure of of control control or or power then then she she would would be be but but half half a a queen queen and and
would would be be led led either either to to marry marry him him or or else else to to let let him him sway sway her her as as he he
would

the the reason reason given one one may may say say with with confidence confidence that while while
light light loves loves were were fleeting she she a a deep deep affection affection to to
this this handsome bold and and brilliant brilliant and and cherished cherished him him in in a a far far
different different way way from from any any of of the the others was was as as near near as as she she ever ever came came
to to marriage and and it it was was this this love love at at least least which which makes makes
famous famous line line as as false false as as it it is is beautiful when when he he the imperial imperial
as as passing passing by by in maiden maiden meditation fancy fancy free








and and are are the the two two who who have have most most the the
fancy fancy of of poets and and from from their their own own time time
down down to to the the present present day

some some respects respects there there is is a a certain certain likeness likeness in in their their
was was queen queen of of a a nation nation whose whose affairs affairs were were entangled entangled with with those those of of a a much much
greater greater one sought sought for for her her own own ideal ideal of of love love until until she she found found it
won won that that love love recklessly almost almost madly in in its its attainment
fell fell from from power power and and fortune before before her her natural natural life life was was

a a mighty mighty state other other lost lost her her own own crown crown in in order order that that she she might might
achieve achieve the the whole whole desire desire of of her her heart

is is still still another another parallel parallel which which may may be be found of of these these
was was to to be be exquisitely exquisitely beautiful yet yet each each fell fell short short of of
highest highest are are alike alike remembered remembered in in song song and and story story because because
of of qualities qualities that that are are far far more more powerful powerful than than any any physical physical charm charm can can be
impressed impressed the the imagination imagination of of their their own own just just as as they they
had had impressed impressed the the imagination imagination of of all all succeeding succeeding ages by by reason reason of of a a
strange strange and and irresistible irresistible fascination fascination which which no no one one could could explain but but
which which very very few few could could experience experience and and resist

corruption corruption which which she she had had brought brought from from her her native native was indeed
a a singular singular for for a a girl girl of of character

up up in in these these surroundings surroundings until until she she was was sixteen eating eating
the the fruit fruit which which a a knowledge knowledge of of both both good good and and evil intelligence intelligence
was was very very great quickly quickly learned learned and and was was
a a daring daring horsewoman was was a a poet poet and and an an artist artist even even in in her her teens
was was also also a a keen keen judge judge of of human human motives for for those those early early years years of of hers hers
had had forced forced her her into into a a womanhood womanhood that that was was premature premature but but wonderful had had
been been proposed proposed that that she she should should marry marry the the eldest eldest son son of of so so
that that in in time time the the kingdom kingdom of of and and that that of of might might be be united
while while if if of of were were to to die die unmarried unmarried her her realm realm also also would would

husband husband and and she she was was left left a a widow restless ambitious and and yet yet no no
longer longer having having any any of of the the power power she she loved

at at this this time time had had become become a a woman woman whose whose fascination fascination was was
over over all all who who her was was very very tall tall and and very very slim with with
chestnut chestnut hair like a a flower flower of of the the heat both both lax lax and and delicate
skin skin was was fair fair and and pale so so clear clear and and so so transparent transparent as as to to make make the the story story
plausible plausible that that when when she she from from a a flask flask of of wine the the red red liquid liquid could could
be be seen seen passing passing down down her her slender slender throat

with with all all this this she she was was not not fine fine in in texture but but hardy hardy as as a a man

was was on on the the twentieth twentieth of of was was
returning returning from from a a journey journey to to a a patient patient for had had now now to to
civil civil practice when when my my way way led led me me through through
passed passed the the door which which must must always always be be associated associated
in in my my mind mind with with my my wooing and and with with the the dark dark of of the the
in in was was seized seized with with a a keen keen desire desire to to see see
again and and to to know know how how he he was was his his extraordinary extraordinary powers
rooms rooms were were brilliantly brilliantly and even even as as up saw saw
his his tall spare spare figure figure pass pass twice twice in in a a dark dark silhouette silhouette against against
the the blind was was pacing pacing the the room room swiftly eagerly with with his his head head
sunk sunk upon upon his his chest chest and and his his hands hands behind behind him me who who
his his every every mood mood and and habit his his attitude attitude and and manner manner told told their their
own own story was was at at work work again had had risen risen out out of of his his
dreams dreams and and was was hot hot upon upon the the scent scent of of some some new new
problem the the bell bell and and was was shown shown up up to to the the chamber chamber which which
had had formerly formerly been been in in part part my my own

manner manner was was not not effusive seldom seldom was but but he he was was glad
think to to see see me hardly hardly a a word word spoken but but with with a a kindly kindly
eye he he me me to to an an armchair across across his his case case of of
and and indicated indicated a a spirit spirit case case and and a a in in the the corner he he
stood stood before before the the fire fire and and me me over over in in his his singular singular
introspective introspective fashion

you he he think that that you you have have
put put on on seven seven and and a a half half pounds pounds since since saw saw you



should should have have thought thought a a little little more a a trifle trifle more
fancy in in practice practice again observe did did not not
tell tell me me that that you you intended intended to to go go into into harness

how how do do you you know

see see it deduce deduce it do do know know that that you you have have been been getting getting
yourself yourself very very wet wet lately and and that that you you have have a a most most clumsy clumsy and and
careless careless servant servant girl

dear dear said said this is is too too much would would certainly certainly
have have been been burned had had you you lived lived a a few few ago is is true true
that that had had a a country country walk walk on on and and came came home home in in a a dreadful dreadful
mess but but as as have have changed changed my my clothes clothes can't cant imagine imagine how how you you
deduce deduce it to to she she is is incorrigible and and my my wife wife has has
given given her her notice but but there again fail fail to to see see how how you you work work it it
out

to to himself himself and and his his long nervous nervous hands hands
together

is is simplicity simplicity itself said said he my eyes eyes tell tell me me that that on on the the
inside inside of of your your left left shoe just just where where the the firelight firelight strikes strikes it
the the leather leather is is by by six six almost almost parallel parallel they they
have have been been caused caused by by who who has has very very carelessly carelessly scraped scraped round round
the the of of the the sole sole in in order order to to remove remove crusted crusted mud mud from from it
you you see my my double double deduction deduction that that you you had had been been out out in in vile vile
weather and and that that you you had had a a particularly particularly malignant malignant
specimen specimen of of the the to to your your practice if if a a
gentleman gentleman walks walks into into my my rooms rooms smelling smelling of of iodoform with with a a black black
mark mark of of nitrate nitrate of of silver silver upon upon his his right right forefinger and and a a bulge bulge
on on the the right right side side of of his his to to show show where where he he has has
his his stethoscope must must be be dull indeed if if do do not not pronounce pronounce
him him to to be be an an active active member member of of the the medical medical profession

could could not not help help laughing laughing at at the the ease ease with with which which he he his his
process process of of deduction hear hear you you give give your your reasons
the thing thing always always to to me me to to be be so so ridiculously ridiculously
simple simple that that could could easily easily do do it it myself though though at at each each
successive successive instance instance of of your your reasoning reasoning am am baffled baffled until until you you
explain explain your your process yet yet believe believe that that my my eyes eyes are are as as good good
as as yours

so he he lighting lighting a a cigarette and and
himself himself down down into into an an armchair see but but you you do do not not observe
distinction distinction is is clear example you you have have frequently frequently seen seen
the the steps steps which which lead lead up up from from the the hall hall to to this this room



often

some some hundreds hundreds of of times

how how many many are are there

many don't dont know

so have have not not observed yet yet you you have have seen is is
just just my my point know know that that there there are are seventeen seventeen steps
because because have have both both seen seen and and observed since since you you are are
interested interested in in these these little little and and since since you you are are good good
enough enough to to chronicle chronicle one one or or two two of of my my trifling trifling experiences you you
may may be be interested interested in in this over over a a sheet sheet of of thick

theories instead instead of of theories theories to to suit suit facts the the note note itself
do do you you deduce deduce from from it

carefully carefully the the writing and and the the paper paper upon upon which which it it was was
written

o'clock oclock should should like like to to chat chat this this little little matter matter over over with with you




three three o'clock oclock precisely precisely was was at at but but had had
not not yet yet informed informed me me that that he he had had left left the the
house house shortly shortly after after eight eight o'clock oclock in in the the morning sat sat down down
beside beside the the fire however with with the the intention intention of of him
however however long long he he might might be was was already already deeply deeply interested interested in in his his
inquiry for though though it it was was surrounded surrounded by by none none of of the the grim grim and and
strange strange features features which which were were associated associated with with the the two two crimes crimes which which
have have already already recorded still the the nature nature of of the the case case and and the the
exalted exalted station station of of his his client client it it a a character character of of its its own
apart apart from from the the nature nature of of the the investigation investigation which which my my
friend friend had had on on hand there there was was something something in in his his masterly masterly grasp grasp of of
a a situation and and his his keen incisive incisive reasoning which which made made it it a a
pleasure pleasure to to me me to to study study his his system system of of work and and to to follow follow the the
quick subtle subtle by by which which he he disentangled disentangled the the most most
inextricable inextricable accustomed accustomed was was to to his his invariable invariable
success success that that the the very very possibility possibility of of his his failing failing had had to to
enter enter into into my my head

was was close close upon upon four four before before the the door door opened and and a a
groom and and with with an an
inflamed inflamed face face and and disreputable disreputable clothes walked walked into into the the room
as as was was to to my my friends amazing amazing powers powers in in the the use use of of
had had to to look look three three times times before before was was certain certain that that it it
was was indeed indeed he a a nod nod he he vanished vanished into into the the bedroom whence whence he he
in in five five minutes minutes and and respectable as as of of old
his his hands hands into into his his pockets he he stretched stretched out out his his legs legs in in
front front of of the the fire fire and and heartily heartily for for some some minutes

really he he and and then then he he choked choked and and again again
until until he he was was obliged obliged to to lie lie back limp limp and and helpless in in the the
chair

is is it

quite quite too too funny am am sure sure you you could could never never guess guess how how
employed employed my my morning or or what what ended ended by by doing

can't cant imagine suppose suppose that that you you have have been been the the
habits and and perhaps perhaps the the house of of

so but but the the sequel sequel was was rather rather unusual will will tell tell you
however left left the the house house a a little little after after eight eight o'clock oclock this this
morning morning in in the the character character of of a a groom groom out out of of work is is a a
wonderful wonderful sympathy sympathy and and freemasonry freemasonry among among men one one of of
them and and you you will will know know all all that that there there is is to to know soon soon found found
is is a a bijou bijou villa with with a a garden garden at at the the back but but
built built out out in in front front right right up up to to the the road two two lock lock
to to the the door on on the the right right side well well
furnished with with long long windows windows almost almost to to the the floor and and those those
preposterous preposterous window window fasteners fasteners which which a a child child could could open
there there was was nothing nothing remarkable save save that that the the passage passage window window
could could be be from from the the top top of of the the walked walked round round
it it and and it it closely closely from from every every point point of of view but but without without
anything anything else else of of interest

then then down down the the street street and and found as as expected that that
there there was was a a mews mews in in a a lane lane which which runs runs down down by by one one wall wall of of the the
garden lent lent the the a a hand hand in in rubbing rubbing down down their their horses
and and received received in in exchange exchange twopence a a glass glass of of half half and and half two two
of of shag shag tobacco and and as as much much information information as as could could desire desire
about about to to say say nothing nothing of of half half a a dozen dozen other other people people in in
the the in in whom whom was was not not in in the the least least interested but but
whose whose was was compelled compelled to to listen listen to

what what of of asked

she she has has turned turned all all the the mens heads heads down down in in that that part is is
the the thing thing under under a a bonnet bonnet on on this this planet say say the the
to to a a man lives lives quietly at at
out out at at five five every every day and and returns returns at at seven seven sharp sharp for for
dinner goes goes out out at at other other times except except when when she she
only only one one male male visitor but but a a good good deal deal of of him is is dark
handsome and and dashing never never calls calls less less than than once once a a day and and
often often twice is is a a of of the the
the the of of a a cabman cabman as as a a confidant had had driven driven him him
home home a a dozen dozen times times from from and and all all about about him
had had listened listened to to all all they they had had to to tell to to walk walk up up
and and down down near near once once more and and to to think think over over my my plan plan
of of campaign

was was an an important important factor factor in in the the
matter was was a a lawyer ominous was was the the
relation relation between between them and and what what the the object object of of his his repeated repeated
visits she she his his client his his friend or or his his mistress the the
former she she had had probably probably transferred transferred the the photograph photograph to to his his
keeping the the latter it it was was less less likely the the issue issue of of this this
question question depended depended whether whether should should continue continue my my work work at at
or or turn turn my my attention attention to to the the chambers chambers in in the the
was was a a delicate delicate point and and it it the the field field of of my my
inquiry fear fear that that bore bore you you with with these these details but but have have to to
let let you you see see my my little little difficulties if if you you are are to to understand understand the the
situation

am am following following you you closely

was was still still the the matter matter in in my my mind mind when when a a hansom hansom cab cab
drove drove up up to to and and a a gentleman gentleman out was was a a
remarkably remarkably handsome handsome man dark aquiline and and
the the man man of of whom whom had had heard to to be be in in a a
great great hurry shouted shouted to to the the cabman cabman to to wait and and brushed brushed past past the the
maid maid who who opened opened the the door door with with the the air air of of a a man man who who was was thoroughly thoroughly
at at home

was was in in the the house house about about half half an an hour and and could could catch catch
of of him him in in the the windows windows of of the the pacing pacing up up and and
down talking talking excitedly and and waving waving his his arms her her could could see see
nothing he he looking looking even even more more than than
before he he up up to to the the cab he he pulled pulled a a gold gold watch watch from from
his his pocket pocket and and at at it it earnestly like like the the devil he he
shouted first to to in in and and then then to to
the the of of in in the the a a guinea guinea if if
you you do do it it in in twenty twenty minutes

they they and and was was just just whether whether should should not not do do
well well to to follow follow them them when when up up the the lane lane came came a a neat neat little little landau
the the coachman coachman with with his his coat coat only only and and his his tie tie under under
his his ear while while all all the the of of his his harness harness were were sticking sticking out out of of
the the hadn't pulled pulled up up before before she she shot shot out out of of the the hall hall
door door and and into into it only only caught caught a a glimpse glimpse of of her her at at the the moment
but but she she was was a a lovely lovely woman with with a a face face that that a a man man might might die die for

of of she she and half half a a
sovereign sovereign if if you you reach reach it it in in twenty twenty minutes

was was quite quite too too good good to to lose was was just just
whether whether should should run run for for it or or whether whether should should perch perch behind behind her her
landau landau when when a a cab cab came came through through the the street driver driver
twice twice at at such such a a shabby shabby fare but but in in before before he he could could
object of of said said and half half a a sovereign sovereign
if if you you reach reach it it in in twenty twenty minutes was was twenty-five twentyfive minutes minutes to to
twelve and and of of course course it it was was clear clear enough enough what what was was in in the the wind

drove drove fast don't dont think think ever ever drove drove but but the the
others others were were there there before before us cab cab and and the the landau landau with with their their
steaming steaming horses horses were were in in front front of of the the door door when when paid paid
the the man man and and hurried hurried into into the the church was was not not a a soul soul there there
save save the the two two whom whom had had and and a a surpliced surpliced clergyman who who
to to be be with with them were were all all three three
standing standing in in a a knot knot in in front front of of the the altar up up the the side side
aisle aisle like like any any other other idler idler who who has has dropped dropped into into a a church
to to my my surprise the the three three at at the the altar altar faced faced round round to to
me and and came came running running as as hard hard as as he he could could towards towards
me

he he do

then asked

man come only only three three minutes or or it it won't wont be be legal

was was up up to to the the altar and and before before where where was was
found found myself myself mumbling mumbling which which were were whispered whispered in in my my ear
and and for for things things of of which which nothing and and generally generally
in in the the secure secure tying tying up up of of spinster to to
bachelor was was all all done done in in an an instant and and
there there was was the the gentleman gentleman me me on on the the one one side side and and the the lady lady
on on the the other while while the the clergyman clergyman on on me me in in front was was
the the most most preposterous preposterous position position in in which which ever ever found found myself myself in in my my
life and and it it was was the the thought thought of of it it that that me me laughing laughing just just
now seems seems that that there there had had been been some some informality informality about about their their
license that that the the clergyman clergyman absolutely absolutely refused refused to to marry marry them them
without without a a witness witness of of some some sort and and that that my my lucky lucky appearance appearance
saved saved the the bridegroom bridegroom from from having having to to sally sally out out into into the the streets streets in in
search search of of a a best best man bride bride me me a a sovereign and and mean mean
to to wear wear it it on on my my in in memory memory of of the the occasion

is is a a very very unexpected unexpected turn turn of of affairs said said and what what
then

found found my my very very seriously seriously as as if if
the the pair pair might might take take an an immediate immediate departure and and so so necessitate necessitate
very very prompt prompt and and energetic energetic measures measures on on my my part the the church church
door however they they separated he he driving driving back back to to the the and and

was was a a quarter quarter past past six six when when we we left left and and it it still still
wanted wanted ten ten minutes minutes to to the the hour hour when when we we found found ourselves ourselves in in
was was already already dusk and and the the were were just just
being being lighted lighted as as we we paced paced up up and and down down in in front front of of
waiting waiting for for the the coming coming of of its its occupant house house was was just just such such
as as had had it it from from succinct succinct description
but but the the locality locality to to be be less less private private than than expected
the the contrary for for a a small small street street in in a a quiet quiet it it was was
remarkably remarkably animated was was a a group group of of shabbily shabbily dressed dressed men men
smoking smoking and and laughing laughing in in a a corner a a with with his his
wheel two two who who were were flirting flirting with with a a and and
several several young young men men who who were were up up and and down down with with

see as as we we paced paced to to and and fro fro in in front front of of
the the house this marriage marriage rather rather matters
photograph photograph a a double-edged doubleedged weapon weapon now chances chances are are
that that she she would would be be as as averse averse to to its its being being seen seen by by
as as our our client client is is to to its its coming coming to to the the eyes eyes of of his his
princess the the question question is are are we we to to find find the the
photograph

indeed

is is most most unlikely unlikely that that she she it it about about with with her is is
cabinet cabinet size large large for for easy easy concealment concealment about about a a
dress knows knows that that the the is is capable capable of of having having her her
and and of of the the sort sort have have already already been been made
may may take take it then that that she she does does not not carry carry it it about about with with her

then

banker banker or or her her lawyer is is that that double double possibility
am am inclined inclined to to think think neither are are naturally naturally secretive
and and they they like like to to do do their their own own should should she she hand hand it it
over over to to else could could trust trust her her own own guardianship but but
she she could could not not tell tell what what indirect indirect or or political political influence influence might might be be
brought brought to to bear bear upon upon a a business business man remember remember that that she she
had had resolved resolved to to use use it it within within a a few few days must must be be where where she she
can can lay lay her her hands hands upon upon it must must be be in in her her own own house

things things are are very very often often connected connected not not with with the the larger larger but but with with the the
smaller smaller crimes and and occasionally indeed where where there there is is room room for for
doubt doubt whether whether any any positive positive crime crime has has been been committed far far as as
have have heard heard it it is is impossible impossible for for me me to to say say whether whether the the present present
case case is is an an instance instance of of crime crime or or not but but the the course course of of events events is is

fellow fellow for for photography away away with with a a camera camera when when he he ought ought

like like a a rabbit rabbit into into its its hole hole to to develop develop his his pictures is is his his
main main fault but but on on the the whole whole a a good good worker no no vice vice
in in him

is is still still with with you presume

sir and and a a girl girl of of fourteen who who does does a a bit bit of of simple simple
cooking cooking and and keeps keeps the the place place all all have have in in the the
house for for am am a a widower widower and and never never had had any any family live live very very
quietly sir the the three three of of us and and we we keep keep a a roof roof over over our our heads heads
and and pay pay our our debts if if we we do do nothing nothing more

first first thing thing that that put put us us out out was was that that advertisement
he he came came down down into into the the office office just just this this day day eight eight
with with this this very very paper paper in in his his hand and and he he

wish wish to to the the that that was was a a redheaded man

that

he another another vacancy vacancy on on the the of of the the
worth worth quite quite a a little little fortune fortune to to any any man man who who
gets gets it and and understand understand that that there there are are more more than than
there there are are men so so that that the the are are at at their their wits end end what what
to to do do with with the the money my my hair hair would would only only change change
a a nice nice little little crib crib all all ready ready for for me me to to step step into

what what is is it then asked see am am a a
very very stay-at-home stayathome man and and as as my my business business came came to to me me instead instead of of
my my having having to to go go to to it was was often often on on end end without without putting putting
my my foot foot over over the the doormat that that way way didn't know know much much of of what what
was was going going on on outside and and was was always always glad glad of of a a bit bit of of news

you you never never heard heard of of the the of of the the he he
asked asked with with his his eyes eyes open



wonder wonder at at that for for you you are are eligible eligible yourself yourself for for one one
of of the the

what what are are they they worth asked

merely merely a a couple couple of of hundred hundred a a year but but the the work work is is slight
and and it it need need not not interfere interfere very very much much with with ones other other
occupations

you you can can easily easily think think that that that that made made me me prick prick up up my my ears
for for the the business business has has not not been been for for some some years and and an an
extra extra couple couple of of hundred hundred would would have have been been very very handy

me me all all about about it said said

said said he showing showing me me the the advertisement you can can see see for for
yourself yourself that that the the has has a a vacancy and and there there is is the the address address
where where you you should should apply apply for for particulars far far as as can can make make out
the the was was founded founded by by an an millionaire
who who was was very very peculiar peculiar in in his his ways was was himself himself
redheaded and and he he had had a a great great sympathy sympathy for for all all redheaded men
so so when when he he it it was was found found that that he he had had left left his his enormous enormous
fortune fortune in in the the hands hands of of with with instructions instructions to to apply apply the the
interest interest to to the the providing providing of of easy easy to to men men whose whose hair hair is is of of
that that all all hear hear it it is is splendid splendid pay pay and and very very little little to to
do

said said there would would be be millions millions of of redheaded men men who who
would would apply

so so many many as as you you might might think he he see see it it is is
really really confined confined to to and and to to grown grown men had had
from from when when he he was was young and and he he wanted wanted to to do do the the
old old town town a a good good turn again have have heard heard it it is is no no use use your your
if if your your hair hair is is light light red or or dark dark red or or anything anything but but
real real bright blazing fiery fiery red if if you you to to apply
you you would would just just walk walk in but but perhaps perhaps it it would would hardly hardly be be
worth worth your your while while to to put put yourself yourself out out of of the the way way for for the the sake sake of of a a
few few hundred hundred pounds

it it is is a a fact gentlemen as as you you may may see see for for
that that my my hair hair is is of of a a very very full full and and rich rich tint so so that that it it
to to me me that that if if there there was was to to be be any any competition competition in in the the matter matter
stood stood as as good good a a chance chance as as any any man man that that had had ever ever met
to to know know so so much much about about it it that that thought thought he he might might
prove prove useful so so just just ordered ordered him him to to put put up up the the for for
the the day day and and to to come come right right away away with with me was was very very willing willing to to
have have a a holiday so so we we shut shut the the business business up up and and off off for for
the the address address that that was was given given us us in in the the advertisement

never never hope hope to to see see such such a a sight sight as as that that again
north south east and and west west every every man man who who had had a a shade shade of of red red in in
his his hair hair had had into into the the city city to to answer answer the the advertisement
was was choked choked with with redheaded folk and and
like like a a orange orange barrow should should not not have have thought thought
there there were were so so many many in in the the whole whole country country as as were were brought brought together together
by by that that single single advertisement shade shade of of they they
lemon orange brick liver clay
but as as said there there were were not not many many who who had had the the real real
vivid vivid tint saw saw how how many many were were waiting
would would have have given given it it up up in in despair but but would would not not hear hear
of of it he he did did it it could could not not imagine but but he he pushed pushed and and
pulled pulled and and until until he he me me through through the the crowd and and right right up up
to to the the steps steps which which led led to to the the office was was a a double double stream stream
upon upon the the stair some some going going up up in in hope and and some some coming coming back back
dejected but but we we wedged wedged in in as as well well as as we we could could and and soon soon found found
ourselves ourselves in in the the office

experience experience has has been been a a most most entertaining entertaining one
as as his his client client and and refreshed refreshed his his memory memory with with a a huge huge
pinch pinch of of snuff continue continue your your very very interesting interesting statement

was was nothing nothing in in the the office office but but a a couple couple of of wooden wooden
and and a a deal deal table behind behind which which sat sat a a small small man man with with a a head head that that
was was even even than than mine said said a a few few words words to to each each candidate candidate
as as he he came came up and and then then he he always always managed managed to to find find some some fault fault in in
them them which which would would disqualify disqualify them a a vacancy vacancy did did not not seem seem
to to be be such such a a very very easy easy matter after after all when when our our turn turn
came came the the little little man man was was much much more more to to me me than than to to any any of of
the the others and and he he closed closed the the door door as as we we entered so so that that he he
might might have have a a private private word word with with us

is is said said my my assistant and he he is is
willing willing to to fill fill a a vacancy vacancy in in the the

he he is is admirably admirably suited suited for for it the the other other has has
every every requirement cannot cannot recall recall when when have have seen seen anything anything so so
fine a a step step backward his his head head on on one one side and and
at at my my hair hair until until felt felt quite quite bashful suddenly suddenly he he
plunged plunged forward my my hand and and me me on on my my
success

would would be be injustice injustice to to hesitate said said he will
however am am sure excuse excuse me me for for taking taking an an obvious obvious precaution
that that he he seized seized my my hair hair in in both both his his hands and and until until
with with the the pain is is water water in in your your eyes said said he he as as
he he released released me perceive perceive that that all all is is as as it it should should be we we
have have to to be be careful for for we we have have twice twice been been deceived deceived by by and and
once once by by paint could could tell tell you you tales tales of of wax wax which which
would would disgust disgust you you with with human human nature over over to to the the
window window and and shouted shouted through through it it at at the the top top of of his his voice voice that that the the
vacancy vacancy was was filled groan groan of of disappointment disappointment came came up up from from below
and and the the folk folk all all away away in in different different directions directions until until there there
was was not not a a redhead to to be be seen seen except except my my own own and and that that of of the the

face face lengthened lengthened at at this for for thought thought that that was was
not not to to have have the the vacancy vacancy after after all but but after after thinking thinking it it over over for for
a a few few minutes minutes he he said said that that it it would would be be all all right

the the case case of of another said said he the objection objection might might be be
fatal but but we we must must stretch stretch a a point point in in of of a a man man with with such such a a
head head of of hair hair as as yours shall shall you you be be able able to to enter enter upon upon your your

low low spirits spirits again for for had had quite quite persuaded persuaded myself myself that that the the
whole whole affair affair must must be be some some great great hoax hoax or or fraud though though what what its its
object object might might be be could could not not imagine altogether altogether past past
belief belief that that could could make make such such a a will or or that that they they would would pay pay
such such a a sum sum for for doing doing anything anything so so simple simple as as copying copying out out the the
did did what what he he could could to to
cheer cheer me me up but but by by bedtime bedtime had had reasoned reasoned myself myself out out of of the the
whole whole thing in in the the morning morning determined determined to to have have a a look look
at at it it anyhow so so bought bought a a penny penny bottle bottle of of ink and and with with a a

found found ourselves ourselves in in the the morning were were and
following following the the guidance guidance of of we we passed passed down down a a
narrow narrow passage passage and and through through a a side side door which which he he opened opened for for us
there there was was a a small small corridor which which ended ended in in a a very very massive massive
iron iron gate also also was was opened and and led led down down a a flight flight of of winding winding
stone stone steps which which terminated terminated at at another another formidable formidable gate
stopped stopped to to light light a a lantern and and then then conducted conducted us us
down down a a dark passage and and so after after opening opening a a
third third door into into a a huge huge vault vault or or cellar which which was was all all

darkness darkness as as have have never never before before experienced smell smell of of hot hot
metal metal to to assure assure us us that that the the light light was was still still there ready ready
to to flash flash out out at at a a moments notice me with with my my nerves nerves worked worked

an an hour hour and and a a quarter yet yet it it to to me me that that the the night night must must
have have almost almost gone gone and and the the dawn dawn be be breaking breaking above above us limbs limbs
were were weary weary and and stiff for for to to change change my my position yet yet my my
nerves nerves were were worked worked up up to to the the highest highest pitch pitch of of tension and and my my
hearing hearing was was so so acute acute that that could could not not only only hear hear the the gentle gentle
breathing breathing of of my my but but could could distinguish distinguish the the
of of the the bulky bulky from from the the thin sighing sighing note note
of of the the bank bank director my my position position could could look look over over the the case case
in in the the direction direction of of the the floor my my eyes eyes caught caught the the glint glint
of of a a light

first first it it was was but but a a lurid lurid spark spark upon upon the the stone stone pavement
it it lengthened lengthened out out until until it it became became a a yellow yellow line and and then
without without any any warning warning or or sound a a gash gash to to open open and and a a hand hand
a a white almost almost womanly womanly hand which which felt felt about about in in the the
centre centre of of the the little little area area of of light a a minute minute or or more more the the
hand with with its its fingers out out of of the the floor
it it was was as as suddenly suddenly as as it it and and all all was was dark dark
again again save save the the single single lurid lurid spark spark which which marked marked a a chink chink between between
the the stones

disappearance however was was but but momentary a a rending
tearing tearing sound one one of of the the broad white white stones stones turned turned over over upon upon
its its side side and and left left a a square gaping gaping hole through through which which
the the light light of of a a lantern the the edge edge there there a a cleancut
boyish boyish face which which keenly keenly about about it and and then with with a a hand hand
on on either either side side of of the the aperture itself itself and and
until until one one knee knee rested rested upon upon the the edge another another
instant instant he he stood stood at at the the side side of of the the hole hole and and was was hauling hauling after after

had had sprung sprung out out and and seized seized the the intruder intruder by by the the
collar other other down down the the hole and and heard heard the the sound sound of of
rending rending cloth cloth as as at at his his skirts light light

at at bank bank robbery robbery that that have have ever ever come come within within my my experience

have have had had one one or or two two little little scores scores of of my my own own to to settle settle with with
said said have have been been at at some some small small expense expense over over
this this matter which which shall shall expect expect the the bank bank to to refund but but beyond beyond
that that am am amply amply by by having having had had an an experience experience which which is is in in
many many ways ways unique and and by by hearing hearing the the very very remarkable remarkable narrative narrative of of
the the


see he he in in the the early early hours hours of of the the morning morning
as as we we sat sat over over a a glass glass of of whisky whisky and and soda soda in in it
was was perfectly perfectly obvious obvious from from the the first first that that the the only only possible possible
object object of of this this rather rather fantastic fantastic business business of of the the advertisement advertisement of of
the the and and the the copying copying of of the the must must be be to to get get
this this not not pawnbroker pawnbroker out out of of the the way way for for a a number number of of
hours hours every every day was was a a curious curious way way of of it but
really it it would would be be difficult difficult to to suggest suggest a a better method method was was
no no doubt doubt to to ingenious ingenious mind mind by by the the of of his his
hair pounds pounds a a week week was was a a lure lure which which must must draw draw
him and and what what was was it it to to them who who were were playing playing for for
put put in in the the advertisement one one rogue rogue has has the the temporary temporary
office the the other other rogue rogue the the man man to to apply apply for for it and and
together together they they manage manage to to secure secure his his absence absence every every morning morning in in the the
week the the time time that that heard heard of of the the assistant assistant having having come come for for
half half wages it it was was obvious obvious to to me me that that he he had had some some strong strong motive motive
for for the the situation

how how could could you you guess guess what what the the motive motive was

there there been been in in the the house should should have have suspected suspected a a
mere mere vulgar vulgar intrigue however was was out out of of the the question
mans business business was was a a small small one and and there there was was nothing nothing in in his his
house house which which could could account account for for such such elaborate elaborate preparations and and
such such an an expenditure expenditure as as they they were were at must then be be something something
out out of of the the house could could it it be thought thought of of the the
fondness fondness for for photography and and his his trick trick of of vanishing vanishing into into the the
cellar cellar was was the the end end of of this this tangled tangled clue
made made as as to to this this mysterious mysterious assistant assistant and and found found that that
had had to to deal deal with with one one of of the the and and most most daring daring in in
was was doing doing something something in in the the which which
many many hours hours a a day day for for months months on on end could could it it be once once
more could could think think of of nothing nothing save save that that he he was was running running a a tunnel tunnel
to to some some other other building

far far had had when when we we to to visit visit the the scene scene of of action
surprised surprised you you by by beating beating upon upon the the pavement pavement with with my my stick was was
whether whether the the cellar cellar stretched stretched out out in in front front or or behind
was was not not in in front the the bell and as as the the
assistant assistant it have have had had some some but but we we had had
never never set set eyes eyes upon upon each each other other before hardly hardly at at his his
face knees knees were were what what wished wished to to see must must yourself yourself have have
how how worn wrinkled and and stained stained they they were spoke spoke of of
those those hours hours of of only only remaining remaining point point was was what what they they
were were for walked walked round round the the corner saw saw the the and and
on on our our friends premises and and felt felt that that
had had solved solved my my problem you you drove drove home home after after the the concert concert
called called upon upon and and upon upon the the chairman chairman of of the the bank bank
with with the the result result that that you you have have seen

how how could could you you tell tell that that they they would would make make their their attempt attempt
tonight asked

when when they they closed closed their their offices offices that that was was a a sign sign that that
they they no no longer longer about about other other
words that that they they had had completed completed their their tunnel it it was was essential essential
that that they they should should use use it it soon as as it it might might be be discovered or or the the
bullion bullion might might be be removed would would suit suit them them better better than than
any any other other day as as it it would would give give them them two two days days for for their their escape
all all these these reasons reasons expected expected them them to to come come tonight

reasoned reasoned it it out out beautifully in in unfeigned unfeigned
admiration is is so so long long a a chain and and yet yet every every link link rings rings
true

saved saved me me from from ennui he he yawning already already
feel feel it it closing closing in in upon upon me life life is is spent spent in in one one long long effort effort
to to escape escape from from the the of of existence little little
help help me me to to do do so

you you are are a a benefactor benefactor of of the the race said said

his his shoulders perhaps after after all it it is is of of
some some little little use he he cest
cest tout as as wrote wrote to to





dear dear fellow said said as as we we sat sat on on either either side side
of of the the fire fire in in his his at at life is is infinitely infinitely
stranger stranger than than anything anything which which the the mind mind of of man man could could invent
would would not not dare dare to to conceive conceive the the things things which which are are really really mere mere
of of existence we we could could fly fly out out of of that that window window
hand hand in in hand hover hover over over this this great great city gently gently remove remove the the
and and peep peep in in at at the the queer queer things things which which are are going going on the the
strange strange the the the the crosspurposes the the
wonderful wonderful chains chains of of events working working through through and and
leading leading to to the the most most results it it would would make make all all fiction fiction with with
its its and and foreseen foreseen conclusions conclusions most most stale stale and and
unprofitable

yet yet am am not not convinced convinced of of it which which
come come to to light light in in the the papers papers are as as a a rule bald bald enough and and
vulgar vulgar enough have have in in our our police police reports reports realism realism pushed pushed to to
its its extreme extreme limits and and yet yet the the result result is it it must must be be
neither neither fascinating fascinating nor nor artistic

certain certain selection selection and and discretion discretion must must be be used used in in producing producing a a
realistic realistic effect is is wanting wanting in in the the
police police report where where more more stress stress is is laid perhaps upon upon the the
of of the the magistrate magistrate than than upon upon the the details which which to to an an
observer observer contain contain the the vital vital essence essence of of the the whole whole matter
upon upon it there there is is nothing nothing so so unnatural unnatural as as the the commonplace

and and shook shook my my head can can quite quite understand understand your your thinking thinking
so said course in in your your position position of of unofficial unofficial adviser adviser
and and helper helper to to everybody everybody who who is is absolutely absolutely puzzled throughout throughout
three three you you are are brought brought in in contact contact with with all all that that is is
strange strange and and bizarre picked picked up up the the morning morning paper paper
from from the the us us put put it it to to a a practical practical test is is the the
first first heading heading upon upon which which come cruelty cruelty to to his his
wife is is half half a a column column of of print but but know know without without
reading reading it it that that it it is is all all perfectly perfectly familiar familiar to to me is of of
course the the other other woman the the drink the the push the the blow the the
bruise the the sympathetic sympathetic sister sister or or of of
could could invent invent nothing nothing more more crude

your your example example is is an an unfortunate unfortunate one one for for your your argument
said said taking taking the the paper paper and and his his eye eye down down it
is is the the separation separation case and as as it it happens was was engaged engaged
in in clearing clearing up up some some small small points points in in connection connection with with it
husband husband was was a a teetotaler there there was was no no other other woman and and the the
conduct conduct of of was was that that he he had had drifted drifted into into the the habit habit of of
winding winding up up every every meal meal by by taking taking out out his his false false teeth teeth and and hurling hurling
them them at at his his wife which you you will will allow is is not not an an action action likely likely

which which served served them them was was of of such such delicacy delicacy that that cannot cannot confide confide it it
even even to to you who who have have been been good good enough enough to to chronicle chronicle one one or or two two of of
my my little little

have have you you any any on on hand hand just just now asked asked with with interest

ten ten or or twelve but but none none which which present present any any feature feature of of
interest are are important you you understand without without being being
interesting have have found found that that it it is is usually usually in in
unimportant unimportant matters matters that that there there is is a a field field for for the the observation
and and for for the the quick quick analysis analysis of of cause cause and and effect effect which which the the
charm charm to to an an investigation larger larger crimes crimes are are apt apt to to be be the the

which which has has been been to to me me from from there there is is nothing nothing

that that may may have have something something better better before before very very many many minutes minutes are are
over for for this this is is one one of of my my or or am am much much mistaken

had had risen risen from from his his chair chair and and was was standing standing between between the the parted parted
blinds blinds gazing gazing down down into into the the dull dull street
over over his his shoulder saw saw that that on on the the pavement pavement opposite opposite
there there stood stood a a large large woman woman with with a a heavy heavy fur fur boa boa round round her her neck
and and a a large large curling curling red red feather feather in in a a hat hat which which was was
tilted tilted in in a a coquettish coquettish of of fashion fashion over over her her
ear under under this this great great panoply panoply she she up up in in a a nervous
hesitating hesitating fashion fashion at at our our windows while while her her body body
backward backward and and forward and and her her fingers fingers with with her her glove glove
with with a a plunge as as of of the the swimmer swimmer who who leaves leaves
the the bank she she hurried hurried across across the the road and and we we heard heard the the sharp sharp
clang clang of of the the bell

have have seen seen those those before said said his his
cigarette cigarette into into the the fire upon upon the the pavement pavement always always
means means an an affaire affaire de de coeur would would like like advice but but is is not not sure sure
that that the the matter matter is is not not too too delicate delicate for for communication yet yet
even even here here we we may may discriminate a a woman woman has has been been seriously seriously
wronged wronged by by a a man man she she no no longer longer and and the the usual usual symptom symptom
is is a a broken broken bell bell wire we we may may take take it it that that there there is is a a love love
matter but but that that the the maiden maiden is is not not so so much much angry angry as as perplexed or or
here here she she comes comes in in person person to to resolve resolve our our doubts

he he spoke spoke there there was was a a tap tap at at the the door and and the the boy boy in in
entered entered to to announce announce while while the the lady lady herself herself
behind behind his his small small black black figure figure like like a a
behind behind a a tiny tiny pilot pilot boat welcomed welcomed
her her with with the the easy easy courtesy courtesy for for which which he he was was remarkable and
having having closed closed the the door door and and bowed bowed her her into into an an armchair he he
her her over over in in the the minute minute and and yet yet abstracted abstracted fashion fashion which which was was
peculiar peculiar to to him

you you not not find he he said that with with your your short short sight sight it it is is a a
little little trying trying to to do do so so much much typewriting

did did at at first she she but now now know know where where the the letters letters
are are without without looking suddenly suddenly the the full full purport purport
of of his his words she she a a violent violent start start and and up with with fear fear
and and astonishment astonishment upon upon her her broad face
heard heard about about me she she else how how could could you you know know
all all that

mind said said laughing it is is my my business business to to know know
things have have trained trained myself myself to to see see what what others others
overlook not why why should should you you come come to to consult consult me

came came to to you sir because because heard heard of of you you from from
whose whose husband husband you you found found so so easy easy when when the the police police and and everyone everyone had had
given given him him up up for for dead wish wish you you would would do do as as
much much for for me not not rich but but still still have have a a hundred hundred a a year year in in
my my own own right besides besides the the little little that that make make by by the the machine and and
would would give give it it all all to to know know what what has has become become of of

did did you you come come away away to to consult consult me me in in such such a a hurry asked asked
with with his his together together and and his his eyes eyes to to
the the ceiling

a a startled startled look look came came over over the the somewhat somewhat vacuous vacuous face face of of
did did bang bang out out of of the the house she she said
for it it made made me me angry angry to to see see the the easy easy way way in in which which
is my my it it all would would not not go go to to
the the police and and he he would would not not go go to to you and and so so at at last as as he he
would would do do nothing nothing and and kept kept on on saying saying that that there there was was no no harm harm done

near near as as much much as as father father could could have have if if he he had had been been alive

rambling rambling and and inconsequential inconsequential narrative but on on the the contrary he he
had had listened listened with with the the greatest greatest concentration concentration of of attention

prevent said said the the folk folk were were not not fit fit for for us us to to know when when all all
fathers friends friends were were to to be be there he he said said that that had had nothing nothing
fit fit to to wear when when had had my my purple purple plush plush that that had had never never so so much much
as as taken taken out out of of the the drawer last when when nothing nothing else else would would do
he he off off to to upon upon the the business business of of the the firm but but we we

see at at the the ball ball you you met as as understand a a
gentleman gentleman called called

sir met met him him that that night and and he he called called next next day day to to ask ask if if
we we had had home home all all safe and and after after that that we we met met is is to to
say met met him him twice twice for for walks but but after after that that father father
came came back back again and and could could not not come come to to the the house house
any any more



you you know know father father didn't like like anything anything of of the the sort
wouldn't have have any any if if he he could could help help it and and he he used used to to
say say that that a a woman woman should should be be happy happy in in her her own own family family circle
then as as used used to to say say to to mother a a woman woman wants wants her her own own circle circle to to
begin begin with and and had had not not mine mine yet

how how about about he he make make no no attempt attempt to to see see
you

father father was was going going off off to to again again in in a a week and and
wrote wrote and and said said that that it it would would be be and and better better not not to to see see each each
other other until until he he had had gone could could write write in in the the meantime and and he he
used used to to write write every every day the the letters letters in in in in the the morning so so
there there was was no no need need for for father father to to know

that that it it was was

did did you you address address your your letters then

the the to to be be left left till till called called
for said said that that if if they they were were sent sent to to the the office office he he would would be be
by by all all the the other other about about having having letters letters from from a a lady
so so offered offered to to them like like he he did did his but but he he wouldn't
have have that for for he he said said that that when when wrote wrote them them they they to to come come
from from me but but when when they they were were he he always always felt felt that that the the
machine machine had had come come between between us will will just just show show you you how how fond fond he he
was was of of me and and the the little little things things that that he he would would think think
of

was was most most suggestive said said has has long long been been an an axiom axiom
of of mine mine that that the the little little things things are are infinitely infinitely the the most most important
you you remember remember any any other other little little things things about about

was was a a very very shy shy man would would rather rather walk walk with with me me
in in the the evening evening than than in in the the daylight for for he he said said that that he he hated hated to to
be be conspicuous retiring retiring and and gentlemanly gentlemanly he he was his his
voice voice was was gentle had had the the quinsy quinsy and and swollen swollen when when he he
was was young he he told told me and and it it had had left left him him with with a a weak weak throat
and and a a hesitating fashion fashion of of speech was was always always
well well dressed very very neat neat and and plain but but his his eyes eyes were were weak just just
as as mine mine are and and he he tinted tinted glasses glasses against against the the glare

and and what what when when your your stepfather
to to

came came to to the the house house again again and and proposed proposed that that we we
should should marry marry before before father father came came back was was in in dreadful dreadful earnest earnest
and and made made me me swear with with my my hands hands on on the the that that whatever whatever
would would always always be be true true to to him said said he he was was quite quite
right right to to make make me me swear and and that that it it was was a a sign sign of of his his passion
was was all all in in his his from from the the first first and and was was even even fonder fonder
of of him him than than was when when they they talked talked of of within within the the
week to to ask ask about about father but but they they both both said said never never to to
mind mind about about father but but just just to to tell tell him him afterwards and and mother mother
said said she she would would make make it it all all right right with with him didn't quite quite like like
that funny funny that that should should ask ask his his leave as as
he he was was only only a a few few years years older older than than me but but didn't want want to to do do
anything anything on on the the sly so so wrote wrote to to father father at at where where the the
company company has has its its offices but but the the letter letter came came back back to to me me on on
the the very very morning morning of of the the wedding

him then

sir for for he he had had to to just just before before it it

that that was was unfortunate wedding wedding was was arranged then for for
the the it it to to be be in in church

sir but but very very quietly was was to to be be at at near near
and and we we were were to to have have breakfast breakfast afterwards afterwards at at the the
came came for for us us in in a a hansom but but as as there there were were
two two of of us us he he put put us us both both into into it it and and himself himself into into a a
fourwheeler which which to to be be the the only only other other cab cab in in the the
street to to the the church church first and and when when the the four-wheeler fourwheeler
drove drove up up we we for for him him to to step step out but but he he never never did and and
when when the the cabman cabman down down from from the the box box and and there there was was no no one one
there cabman cabman said said that that he he could could not not imagine imagine what what had had become become
of of him for for he he had had seen seen him him get get in in with with his his own own eyes was was
last last and and have have never never seen seen or or heard heard anything anything
since since then then to to throw throw any any light light upon upon what what became became of of him

seems seems to to me me that that you you have have been been very very treated said said


no sir was was too too good good and and kind kind to to leave leave me me so all all
the the morning morning he he was was saying saying to to me me that whatever whatever was was to to
be be true and and that that even even if if something something quite quite unforeseen unforeseen occurred occurred to to
separate separate us was was always always to to remember remember that that was was pledged pledged to to him
and and that that he he would would claim claim his his pledge pledge sooner sooner or or later
strange strange talk talk for for a a but but what what has has since since
a a meaning meaning to to it

certainly certainly it it does own own opinion opinion is then that that some some
unforeseen unforeseen catastrophe catastrophe has has occurred occurred to to him

sir believe believe that that he he some some danger or or else else he he
would would not not have have talked talked so then then think think that that what what he he


you you have have no no notion notion as as to to what what it it could could have have been



more more question did did your your mother mother take take the the matter

was was angry and and said said that that was was never never to to speak speak of of the the matter matter
again

your your father you you tell tell him

and and he he to to think with with me that that something something had had
and and that that should should hear hear of of again he he said
what what interest interest could could have have in in bringing bringing me me to to the the doors doors of of
the the church and and then then leaving leaving me if if he he had had borrowed borrowed my my
money or or if if he he had had married married me me and and my my money money settled settled on on him
there there might might be be some some reason but but was was very very independent independent about about
money money and and never never would would look look at at a a shilling shilling of of mine yet what what
could could have have why why could could he he not not write it it me me
to to think think of of it and and can't cant sleep sleep a a wink wink at at night
pulled pulled a a little little handkerchief handkerchief out out of of her her muff muff and and to to sob sob
heavily heavily into into it

shall shall glance glance into into the the case case for for you said said rising and
have have no no doubt doubt that that we we shall shall reach reach some some definite definite result the the
weight weight of of the the matter matter rest rest upon upon me me now and and do do not not let let your your mind mind
dwell dwell upon upon it it further all try try to to let let
vanish vanish from from your your memory as as he he has has done done from from your your life

all all the the preposterous preposterous hat hat and and the the vacuous vacuous face there there was was
something something noble noble in in the the simple simple faith faith of of our our visitor visitor which which
compelled compelled our our respect laid laid her her little little bundle bundle of of papers papers upon upon
the the table table and and her her way with with a a promise promise to to come come again again whenever whenever
she she might might be be

sat sat silent silent for for a a few few minutes minutes with with his his
still still pressed pressed together his his legs legs stretched stretched out out in in front front of of him
and and his his gaze gaze directed directed upward upward to to the the ceiling he he down down
from from the the rack rack the the old old and and oily oily clay clay pipe which which was was to to him him as as a a
counsellor and having having it he he leaned leaned back back in in his his chair with with
the the thick thick blue blue spinning spinning up up from from him and and a a look look of of
infinite infinite languor languor in in his his face

an an interesting interesting study that that maiden he he observed found found
her her more more interesting interesting than than her her little little problem which by by the the way
is is rather rather a a trite trite one will will find find parallel parallel if if you you
consult consult my my index in in in in and and there there was was something something of of
the the sort sort at at last last year as as is is the the idea however
there there were were one one or or two two details details which which were were new new to to me the the
maiden maiden herself herself was was most most instructive

to to read read a a good good deal deal upon upon her her which which was was quite quite
invisible invisible to to me

invisible invisible but but unnoticed did did not not know know where where to to
look and and so so you you all all that that was was important can can never never bring bring
you you to to the the importance importance of of sleeves the the of of
or or the the great great that that may may hang hang from from a a bootlace
what what did did you you gather gather from from that that appearance
it

she she had had a a straw straw hat with with a a
feather feather of of a a red jacket jacket was was black with with black black beads beads
upon upon it and and a a fringe fringe of of little little black black jet jet
dress dress was was brown rather rather than than coffee coffee with with a a little little
purple purple plush plush at at the the neck neck and and sleeves gloves gloves were were and and
were were worn worn through through at at the the right right forefinger boots boots didn't
observe had had small small round hanging hanging gold gold and and a a
general general air air of of being being fairly fairly in in a a vulgar comfortable
easygoing way

his his hands hands softly softly together together and and

my my word you you are are coming coming along along wonderfully have have
really really done done very very well well indeed is is true true that that you you have have
everything everything of of importance but but you you have have hit hit upon upon the the method and and
you you have have a a quick quick eye eye for for trust trust to to general general
my my boy but but concentrate concentrate yourself yourself upon upon details
first first glance glance is is always always at at a a sleeve a a man man it it is is
perhaps perhaps better better first first to to take take the the knee knee of of the the trouser you you
observe this this woman woman had had plush plush upon upon her her sleeves which which is is a a most most
useful useful material material for for showing showing traces double double line line a a little little
above above the the wrist where where the the against against the the table
was was beautifully beautifully defined of of the the hand hand type
leaves leaves a a similar similar mark but but only only on on the the left left arm and and on on the the side side
of of it it farthest farthest from from the the thumb instead instead of of being being right right across across the the
part as as this this was then then at at her her face and
observing observing the the dint dint of of a a pince-nez pincenez at at either either side side of of her her nose
a a remark remark upon upon short short sight sight and and typewriting which which
to to surprise surprise her

surprised surprised me

surely it it was was obvious was was then then much much surprised surprised and and
interested interested on on down down to to observe observe that though though the the boots boots
which which she she was was wearing wearing were were not not unlike unlike each each other they they were were
really really odd odd ones the the one one having having a a slightly slightly toecap and and
the the other other a a plain plain one was was buttoned buttoned only only in in the the two two lower lower
out out of of five and and the the other other at at the the first third and and
fifth when when you you see see that that a a young young lady otherwise otherwise neatly neatly
dressed has has come come away away from from home home with with odd odd boots
it it is is no no great great deduction deduction to to say say that that she she came came away away in in a a hurry

what what else asked keenly keenly interested as as always always was by by
my my friends incisive incisive reasoning

noted in in passing that that she she had had written written a a note note before before leaving leaving
home home but but after after being being fully fully dressed observed observed that that her her right right
glove glove was was torn torn at at the the forefinger but but you you did did not not apparently apparently see see
that that both both glove glove and and finger finger were were stained stained with with violet violet ink had had
written written in in a a hurry hurry and and dipped dipped her her pen pen too too deep must must have have been been
this this morning or or the the mark mark would would not not remain remain clear clear upon upon the the finger
this this is is amusing though though rather rather elementary but but must must go go back back
to to business you you mind mind reading reading me me the the advertised advertised
description description of of

held held the the little little printed printed slip slip to to the the light

it it said on the the morning morning of of the the fourteenth a a gentleman gentleman
named named five five seven seven in in in height
strongly strongly built sallow sallow complexion black black hair a a little little bald bald in in
the the centre bushy black black and and moustache tinted tinted
glasses slight slight infirmity infirmity of of speech dressed when when last last seen
in in black black faced faced with with silk black black waistcoat gold gold
chain and and grey grey tweed tweed trousers with with brown brown over over
boots to to have have been been employed employed in in an an office office in in
bringing

will will do said said to to the the letters he he continued
over over them they are are very very commonplace no no
clue clue in in them them to to save save that that he he once
is is one one remarkable remarkable point however which which will will no no doubt doubt strike strike
you

are are

only only that but but the the signature signature is is at at the the
neat neat little little at at the the bottom is is a a date you you
see but but no no superscription superscription except except which which is is
rather rather vague point point about about the the signature signature is is very very
fact we we may may call call it it conclusive

what

dear dear fellow is is it it possible possible you you do do not not see see how how strongly strongly it it
upon upon the the case

cannot cannot say say that that do do unless unless it it were were that that he he wished wished to to be be able able
to to deny deny his his signature signature if if an an action action for for breach breach of of promise promise were were


that that was was not not the the point shall shall write write two two letters
which which should should settle settle the the matter is is to to a a firm firm in in the the the the
other other is is to to the the young young ladys stepfather asking asking
him him whether whether he he could could meet meet us us here here at at six six o'clock oclock tomorrow tomorrow
evening is is just just as as well well that that we we should should do do business business with with the the
male male now we we can can do do nothing nothing until until the the
answers answers to to those those letters letters come so so we we may may put put our our little little problem problem
upon upon the the shelf shelf for for the the interim

had had had had so so many many reasons reasons to to believe believe in in my my friends subtle subtle powers powers
of of reasoning reasoning and and extraordinary extraordinary energy energy in in action action that that felt felt that that
he he must must have have some some solid solid grounds grounds for for the the assured assured and and easy easy
with with which which he he treated treated the the singular singular mystery mystery which which he he had had
been been called called upon upon to to fathom only only had had known known him him to to fail in in
the the case case of of the the of of and and of of the the
photograph but but when when back back to to the the weird weird business business of of the the
of of and and the the extraordinary extraordinary circumstances circumstances connected connected with with
the the in in felt felt that that it it would would be be a a strange strange tangle tangle
indeed indeed which which he he could could not not unravel

left left him him then still still puffing puffing at at his his black black clay clay pipe with with the the
conviction conviction that that when when came came again again on on the the next next evening evening would would
find find that that he he held held in in his his hands hands all all the the which which would would lead lead up up
to to the the identity identity of of the the disappearing disappearing bridegroom bridegroom of of


professional professional case case of of great great gravity gravity was was engaging engaging my my own own
attention attention at at the the time and and the the whole whole of of next next day day was was busy busy at at
the the bedside bedside of of the the sufferer was was not not until until close close upon upon six six
o'clock oclock that that found found myself myself free free and and was was able able to to spring spring into into a a
hansom hansom and and drive drive to to half half afraid afraid that that might might be be too too
late late to to assist assist at at the the of of the the little little mystery found found
alone however half half asleep with with his his long thin thin
form form curled curled up up in in the the recesses recesses of of his his armchair formidable formidable
array array of of bottles bottles and and with with the the pungent pungent cleanly cleanly smell smell
of of acid told told me me that that he he had had spent spent his his day day in in the the
chemical chemical work work which which was was so so dear dear to to him

have have you you solved solved it asked asked as as entered

was was the the of of baryta

no the the mystery

that thought thought of of the the salt salt that that have have been been working working upon
was was never never any any mystery mystery in in the the matter though as as said said
yesterday some some of of the the details details are are of of interest only only drawback drawback
is is that that there there is is no no law fear that that can can touch touch the the scoundrel

was was he then and and what what was was his his object object in in deserting deserting


question question was was hardly hardly out out of of my my mouth and and had had not not yet yet
opened opened his his lips lips to to reply when when we we heard heard a a heavy heavy footfall footfall in in the the
passage passage and and a a tap tap at at the the door

is is the the stepfather said said
has has written written to to me me to to say say that that he he would would be be here here at at
six in

man man who who entered entered was was a a sturdy fellow some some
thirty thirty years years of of age and and with with a a
bland manner and and a a pair pair of of wonderfully wonderfully sharp sharp and and
penetrating penetrating grey grey eyes shot shot a a questioning questioning glance glance at at each each of of
us placed placed his his shiny shiny upon upon the the sideboard and and with with a a
slight slight bow bow down down into into the the nearest nearest chair

said said think think that that
this this letter letter is is from from you in in which which you you made made an an
appointment appointment with with me me for for six six oclock

sir am am afraid afraid that that am am a a little little late but but am am not not
quite quite my my own own master you you know am am sorry sorry that that
has has troubled troubled you you about about this this little little matter for for think think it it is is far far
better better not not to to wash wash linen linen of of the the sort sort in in public was was quite quite
against against my my wishes wishes that that she she came but but she she is is a a very very excitable
impulsive impulsive girl as as you you may may have have noticed and and she she is is not not easily easily
controlled controlled when when she she has has made made up up her her mind mind on on a a point course
did did not not mind mind you you so so much as as you you are are not not connected connected with with the the
official official police but but it it is is not not pleasant pleasant to to have have a a family family
misfortune misfortune like like this this abroad it it is is a a useless useless
expense for for how how could could you you possibly possibly find find this this

the the contrary said said quietly have have every every reason reason to to
believe believe that that will will succeed succeed in in

a a violent violent start start and and dropped dropped his his gloves am am
delighted delighted to to hear hear it he he said

is is a a curious curious thing that a a typewriter typewriter has has
really really quite quite as as much much individuality individuality as as a a mans handwriting
they they are are quite quite new no no two two of of them them write write exactly exactly alike
letters letters get get more more worn worn than than others and and some some wear wear only only on on one one
side you you remark remark in in this this note note of of yours that that
in in every every case case there there is is some some little little over over of of the the e and and
a a slight slight defect defect in in the the tail tail of of the the r are are fourteen fourteen other other
but but those those are are the the more more obvious

do do all all our our correspondence correspondence with with this this machine machine at at the the office
and and no no doubt doubt it it is is a a little little worn our our visitor visitor
keenly keenly at at with with his his bright bright little little eyes

now now will will show show you you what what is is really really a a very very interesting interesting study
continued think think of of writing writing another another
little little monograph monograph some some of of these these days days on on the the typewriter typewriter and and its its
relation relation to to crime is is a a subject subject to to which which have have devoted devoted some some
little little attention have have here here four four letters letters which which purport purport to to come come
from from the the missing missing man are are all all each each case not not
only only are are the the es slurred slurred and and the the rs but but you you will will
observe if if you you care care to to use use my my lens that that the the fourteen fourteen
other other to to which which have have are are there there as as well

out out of of his his chair chair and and picked picked up up his his hat
cannot cannot waste waste time time over over this this sort sort of of fantastic fantastic talk
he he said you you can can catch catch the the man catch catch him and and let let me me know know
when when you you have have done done it

said said stepping stepping over over and and turning turning the the key key in in
the the door let let you you know then that that have have caught caught him

where shouted shouted turning turning white white to to his his lips lips
and and about about him him like like a a rat rat in in a a trap

it it won't wont it it wont said said suavely
is is no no possible possible getting getting out out of of it is is quite quite too too
transparent and and it it was was a a very very bad bad compliment compliment when when you you said said that that
it it was was impossible impossible for for me me to to solve solve so so simple simple a a question
right down down and and let let us us talk talk it it over

visitor visitor collapsed collapsed into into a a chair with with a a ghastly ghastly face face and and a a
glitter glitter of of moisture moisture on on his his brow not not actionable he he


am am very very much much afraid afraid that that it it is is not between between ourselves
it it was was as as cruel cruel and and selfish selfish and and heartless heartless a a trick trick in in a a
petty petty way way as as ever ever came came before before me let let me me just just run run over over the the
course course of of events and and you you will will contradict contradict me me if if go go wrong

man man sat sat huddled huddled up up in in his his chair with with his his head head sunk sunk upon upon his his
breast like like one one who who is is utterly utterly crushed stuck stuck his his feet feet up up
on on the the corner corner of of the the and leaning leaning back back with with his his hands hands
in in his his pockets talking rather rather to to himself as as it it
than than to to us

man man married married a a woman woman very very much much older older than than himself himself for for her her
money said said he and he he the the use use of of the the money money of of the the
daughter daughter as as long long as as she she lived lived with with them was was a a considerable considerable
sum for for people people in in their their position and and the the loss loss of of it it would would have have
made made a a serious serious difference was was worth worth an an effort effort to to preserve preserve it
daughter daughter was was of of a a good amiable amiable disposition but but affectionate affectionate
and and warmhearted in in her her ways so so that that it it was was evident evident that that with with
her her fair fair personal personal and and her her little little income she she would would
not not be be allowed allowed to to remain remain single single long her her marriage marriage would would
mean of of course the the loss loss of of a a hundred hundred a a year so so what what does does her her
stepfather stepfather do do to to prevent prevent it takes takes the the obvious obvious course course of of
keeping keeping her her at at home home and and forbidding forbidding her her to to seek seek the the company company of of
people people of of her her own own age soon soon he he found found that that that that would would not not
answer answer forever became became restive upon upon her her rights and and
finally finally announced announced her her positive positive intention intention of of going going to to a a certain certain
ball does does her her clever clever stepfather stepfather do do then an an

was was only only a a joke joke at at first our our visitor never never
thought thought that that she she would would have have been been so so carried carried away

likely likely not that that may may be the the young young lady lady was was very very
decidedly decidedly carried carried away and having having quite quite made made up up her her mind mind that that
her her stepfather stepfather was was in in the the suspicion suspicion of of treachery treachery never never
for for an an instant instant entered entered her her mind was was by by the the
attentions and and the the effect effect was was increased increased by by the the
loudly loudly expressed expressed admiration admiration of of her her mother
to to call for for it it was was obvious obvious that that the the matter matter should should be be pushed pushed as as
far far as as it it would would go go if if a a real real effect effect were were to to be be produced
were were and and an an engagement which which would would finally finally secure secure the the
affections affections from from turning turning towards towards else the the
deception deception could could not not be be kept kept up up forever pretended pretended journeys journeys
to to were were rather rather cumbrous thing thing to to do do was was clearly clearly to to
bring bring the the business business to to an an end end in in such such a a dramatic dramatic manner manner that that it it
would would leave leave a a permanent permanent impression impression upon upon the the young young ladys mind mind and and
prevent prevent her her from from looking looking upon upon any any other other suitor suitor for for some some time time to to
come those those vows vows of of fidelity fidelity upon upon a a and and
hence hence also also the the to to a a possibility possibility of of something something happening happening
on on the the very very morning morning of of the the wedding wished wished
to to be be so so bound bound to to and and so so uncertain uncertain as as to to
his his fate that that for for ten ten years years to to come at at any any rate she she would would not not
listen listen to to another another man far far as as the the church church door door he he brought brought her
and and then as as he he could could go go no no farther he he conveniently conveniently vanished vanished
away away by by the the old old trick trick of of stepping stepping in in at at one one door door of of a a
four-wheeler fourwheeler and and out out at at the the other think think that that was was the the chain chain of of
events

visitor visitor had had something something of of his his assurance assurance while while
had had been been talking and and he he rose rose from from his his chair chair now now with with a a cold cold
sneer sneer upon upon his his pale pale face

may may be be so or or it it may may not said said he but if if you you
are are so so very very sharp sharp you you ought ought to to be be sharp sharp enough enough to to know know that that it it is is
you you who who are are breaking breaking the the law law now and and not not me have have done done nothing nothing
actionable actionable from from the the first but but as as long long as as you you keep keep that that door door
you you lay lay yourself yourself open open to to an an action action for for assault assault and and illegal illegal
constraint

law law cannot as as you you say touch touch you said said
and and open open the the door yet there there never never was was a a man man who who
deserved deserved punishment punishment more the the young young lady lady has has a a brother brother or or a a
friend he he ought ought to to lay lay a a whip whip across across your your shoulders
he he continued up up at at the the sight sight of of the the bitter bitter sneer sneer upon upon
the the mans face it is is not not part part of of my my duties duties to to my my client but but
a a hunting hunting crop crop handy and and think think shall shall just just treat treat
myself myself to two two swift swift steps steps to to the the whip but but before before he he
could could grasp grasp it it there there was was a a wild wild clatter clatter of of steps steps upon upon the the stairs
the the heavy heavy hall hall door door and and from from the the window window we we could could see see
running running at at the the top top of of his his speed speed down down the the road

a a cold-blooded coldblooded scoundrel said said laughing as as he he
himself himself down down into into his his chair chair once once more fellow fellow will will
rise rise from from crime crime to to crime crime until until he he does does something something very very bad and and
ends ends on on a a gallows case case has in in some some respects been been not not
entirely entirely devoid devoid of of interest

cannot cannot now now entirely entirely see see all all the the steps steps of of your your reasoning


of of course course it it was was obvious obvious from from the the first first that that this this
must must have have some some strong strong object object for for his his curious curious
conduct and and it it was was equally equally clear clear that that the the only only man man who who really really
by by the the incident as as far far as as we we could could see was was the the
stepfather the the fact fact that that the the two two men men were were never never together
but but that that the the one one always always when when the the other other was was away was was
suggestive were were the the tinted tinted spectacles spectacles and and the the curious curious voice
which which both both at at a a disguise as as did did the the bushy bushy
suspicions suspicions were were all all confirmed confirmed by by his his peculiar peculiar action action in in
typewriting typewriting his his signature which of of course that that his his
handwriting handwriting was was so so familiar familiar to to her her that that she she would would even even
the the smallest smallest sample sample of of it see see all all these these isolated isolated facts
together together with with many many minor minor ones all all pointed pointed in in the the same same
direction

how how did did you you verify verify them

once once spotted spotted my my man it it was was easy easy to to get get corroboration
the the firm firm for for which which this this man man worked taken taken the the printed printed
description everything everything from from it it which which could could be be the the
result result of of a a the the glasses the the voice and and
sent sent it it to to the the firm with with a a request request that that they they would would inform inform me me
whether whether it it to to the the description description of of any any of of their their
travellers had had already already noticed noticed the the peculiarities peculiarities of of the the
typewriter and and wrote wrote to to the the man man himself himself at at his his business business
address address asking asking him him if if he he would would come come here expected his his
reply reply was was and and revealed revealed the the same same trivial trivial but but
characteristic characteristic same same post post brought brought me me a a letter letter from from
of of to to say say that that the the

had had the the carriage carriage to to ourselves ourselves save save for for an an immense immense litter litter of of
papers papers which which had had brought brought with with him these these he he
and and read with with intervals intervals of of and and of of meditation until until
we we were were past past he he suddenly suddenly rolled rolled them them all all into into a a
gigantic gigantic ball ball and and them them up up the the rack

you you heard heard anything anything of of the the case he he asked

a a word have have not not seen seen a a paper paper for for some some days

press press has has not not had had very very full full accounts have have just just
been been looking looking through through all all the the recent recent papers papers in in order order to to master master the the
particulars seems from from what what gather to to be be one one of of those those
simple simple which which are are so so extremely extremely difficult

sounds sounds a a little little paradoxical

it it is is profoundly profoundly true is is almost almost invariably invariably a a
clue more more featureless featureless and and commonplace commonplace a a crime crime is the the more more
difficult difficult it it is is to to bring bring it it home this this case however they they
have have established established a a very very serious serious case case against against the the son son of of the the
murdered murdered man

is is a a murder then

it it is is to to be be so shall shall take take nothing nothing for for
granted granted until until have have the the opportunity opportunity of of looking looking personally personally into into
it will will explain explain the the state state of of things things to to you as as far far as as have have
been been able able to to understand understand it in in a a very very few few words

is is a a country country district district not not very very far far from from in in
largest largest landed landed proprietor proprietor in in that that part part is is a a
who who made made his his money money in in and and
some some years years ago ago to to the the old old country of of the the which which he he
held that that of of was was let let to to who who was was
also also an an men men had had known known each each other other in in the the
so so that that it it was was not not unnatural unnatural that that when when they they came came to to
settle settle down down they they should should do do so so as as near near each each other other as as possible
was was apparently apparently the the man so so became became his his
tenant tenant but but still still it it seems upon upon terms terms of of perfect perfect
equality as as they they were were frequently frequently together had had one one son
a a lad lad of of eighteen and and had had an an only only daughter daughter of of the the same same
age but but neither neither of of them them had had wives wives living appear appear to to have have
the the society society of of the the and and to to
have have led led retired retired lives though though both both the the were were fond fond of of
sport sport and and were were frequently frequently seen seen at at the the of of the the
kept kept two two man man and and a a girl
had had a a considerable considerable household some some at at the the
least is is as as much much as as have have been been able able to to gather gather about about the the
for for the the facts

that that is on on last left left his his house house at at
about about three three in in the the afternoon afternoon and and walked walked down down to to the the
which which is is a a small small lake lake formed formed by by the the spreading spreading out out
of of the the stream stream which which runs runs down down the the had had been been
out out with with his his in in the the morning morning at at and and he he had had told told
the the man man that that he he must must hurry as as he he had had an an appointment appointment of of
importance importance to to keep keep at at three that that appointment appointment he he never never came came
back back alive

to to the the is is a a quarter quarter of of a a
mile and and two two people people saw saw him him as as he he passed passed over over this this ground
was was an an old old woman whose whose name name is is not not mentioned and and the the other other was was
a a gamekeeper in in the the employ employ of of
these these witnesses witnesses depose depose that that was was walking walking alone
gamekeeper that that within within a a few few minutes minutes of of his his seeing seeing
pass pass he he had had seen seen his his son going going the the
same same way way with with a a gun gun under under his his arm the the best best of of his his belief the the
father father was was actually actually in in sight sight at at the the time and and the the son son was was
following following him thought thought no no more more of of the the matter matter until until he he heard heard in in
the the evening evening of of the the tragedy tragedy that that had had occurred

two two were were seen seen after after the the time time when when
the the gamekeeper lost lost sight sight of of them is is thickly thickly
wooded wooded round with with just just a a fringe fringe of of grass grass and and of of round round the the
edge girl girl of of fourteen who who is is the the daughter daughter of of
the the of of the the estate was was in in one one of of the the
woods woods picking picking flowers states states that that while while she she was was there there she she
saw at at the the border border of of the the wood wood and and close close by by the the lake
and and his his son and and that that they they to to be be having having a a
violent violent quarrel heard heard the the elder elder using using very very
strong strong language language to to his his son and and she she saw saw the the latter latter raise raise up up his his
hand hand as as if if to to strike strike his his father was was so so frightened frightened by by their their
violence violence that that she she away away and and told told her her mother mother when when she she
home home that that she she had had left left the the two two quarrelling quarrelling near near
and and that that she she was was afraid afraid that that they they were were going going to to
fight had had hardly hardly said said the the words words when when young young came came
running running up up to to the the lodge lodge to to say say that that he he had had found found his his father father dead dead
in in the the wood and and to to ask ask for for the the help help of of the the was was
much much excited without without either either his his gun gun or or his his hat and and his his right right
hand hand and and sleeve sleeve were were observed observed to to be be stained stained with with fresh fresh blood
following following him him they they found found the the dead dead body body stretched stretched out out upon upon the the
grass grass beside beside the the pool head head had had been been beaten beaten in in by by repeated repeated
blows blows of of some some heavy heavy and and blunt blunt weapon were were such such as as
might might very very well well have have been been by by the the of of his his sons
gun which which was was found found lying lying on on the the grass grass within within a a few few paces paces of of the the
body these these circumstances circumstances the the young young man man was was
arrested and and a a verdict verdict of of murder having having been been
at at the the inquest inquest on on he he was was on on brought brought before before the the
at at who who have have the the case case to to the the next next
are are the the main main facts facts of of the the case case as as they they came came out out
before before the the coroner coroner and and the the

could could hardly hardly imagine imagine a a more more case
ever ever circumstantial circumstantial evidence evidence pointed pointed to to a a criminal criminal it it does does so so
here

evidence evidence is is a a very very tricky tricky thing
thoughtfully may may seem seem to to point point very very straight straight to to one one thing
but but if if you you shift shift your your own own point point of of view view a a little you you may may find find it it
pointing pointing in in an an equally equally uncompromising uncompromising manner manner to to something something
entirely entirely different must must be be however that that the the case case
looks looks exceedingly exceedingly grave grave against against the the young young man and and it it is is very very
possible possible that that he he is is indeed indeed the the culprit are are several several people people
in in the the however and and among among them them the the
daughter daughter of of the the landowner who who believe believe in in his his
innocence and and who who have have retained retained whom whom you you may may recollect recollect
in in connection connection with with the the in in to to work work out out the the case case in in
his his interest being being rather rather puzzled has has the the
case case to to me and and hence hence it it is is that that two two middle-aged middleaged gentlemen gentlemen are are
flying flying westward westward at at fifty fifty an an hour hour instead instead of of quietly quietly
their their at at home

am am afraid said said that the the facts facts are are so so obvious obvious that that you you
will will find find little little credit credit to to be be out out of of this this case

is is nothing nothing more more deceptive deceptive than than an an obvious obvious fact he he
laughing we we may may chance chance to to hit hit upon upon some some
other other obvious obvious facts facts which which may may have have been been by by no no means means obvious obvious to to
know know me me too too well well to to think think that that am am boasting boasting
when when say say that that shall shall either either confirm confirm or or destroy destroy his his theory theory by by
means means which which he he is is quite quite incapable incapable of of or or even even of of
understanding take take the the first first example example to to hand very very clearly clearly
perceive perceive that that in in your your bedroom bedroom the the window window is is upon upon the the right-hand righthand
side and and yet yet question question whether whether would would have have noted noted
even even so so selfevident a a thing thing as as that

on on earth

dear dear fellow know know you you well know know the the military military neatness neatness
which which you shave shave every every morning and and in in this this
season season you you shave shave by by the the sunlight but but since since your your shaving shaving is is less less
and and less less complete complete as as we we get get farther farther back back on on the the left left side until until
it it positively positively slovenly slovenly as as we we get get round round the the angle angle of of the the
jaw it it is is surely surely very very clear clear that that that that side side is is less less illuminated illuminated
than than the the other could could not not imagine imagine a a man man of of your your habits habits looking looking
at at himself himself in in an an equal equal light light and and being being satisfied satisfied with with such such a a
result only only quote quote this this as as a a trivial trivial example example of of observation observation and and
inference lies lies my my and and it it is is just just possible possible that that
it it may may be be of of some some service service in in the the investigation investigation which which lies lies before before
us are are one one or or two two minor minor points points which which were were brought brought out out in in
the the inquest and and which which are are worth worth considering

are are they

that that his his arrest arrest did did not not take take place place at at once but but after after
the the return return to to the the inspector inspector of of constabulary constabulary
informing informing him him that that he he was was a a prisoner he he that that he he was was not not
surprised surprised to to hear hear it and and that that it it was was no no more more than than his his
observation observation of of his his had had the the natural natural effect effect of of any any
traces traces of of doubt doubt which which might might have have in in the the minds minds of of the the
jury

was was a a confession

for for it it was was by by a a protestation protestation of of innocence

on on the the top top of of such such a a series series of of events it it was was at at
least least a a most most suspicious suspicious remark

the the contrary said said it is is the the rift rift which which
can can at at present present see see in in the the clouds innocent innocent he he might might be
he he could could not not be be such such an an absolute absolute imbecile imbecile as as not not to to see see that that the the
circumstances circumstances were were very very black black against against him he he
surprised surprised at at his his own own arrest or or feigned feigned indignation indignation at at it
should should have have upon upon it it as as highly highly suspicious because because such such
surprise surprise or or anger anger would would not not be be natural natural under under the the circumstances
and and yet yet might might appear appear to to be be the the best best policy policy to to a a man
frank frank acceptance acceptance of of the the situation situation marks marks him him as as either either an an innocent innocent
man or or else else as as a a man man of of considerable considerable self-restraint selfrestraint and and
firmness to to his his remark remark about about his his it it was was also also not not
unnatural unnatural if if you you consider consider that that he he stood stood beside beside the the dead dead body body of of
his his father and and that that there there is is no no doubt doubt that that he he had had that that very very day day
so so far far forgotten forgotten his his filial filial duty duty as as to to bandy bandy words words with with him and and
even according according to to the the little little girl girl whose whose evidence evidence is is so so
important to to raise raise his his hand hand as as if if to to strike strike him
self-reproach selfreproach and and contrition contrition which which are are in in his his remark remark
appear appear to to me me to to be be the the signs signs of of a a healthy healthy mind mind rather rather than than of of a a
guilty guilty one

shook shook my my head men men have have been been hanged hanged on on far far
evidence

they they have many many men men have have been been hanged

is is the the young young mans own own account account of of the the matter

is am am afraid not not very very encouraging encouraging to to his his supporters
though though there there are are one one or or two two points points in in it it which which are are suggestive
will will find find it it here and and may may read read it it for for yourself

picked picked out out from from his his bundle bundle a a copy copy of of the the local local
paper and and having having turned turned down down the the sheet sheet he he pointed pointed out out the the
paragraph paragraph in in which which the the unfortunate unfortunate young young man man had had given given his his own own
statement statement of of what what had had occurred settled settled myself myself down down in in the the
corner corner of of the the carriage carriage and and read read it it very very carefully in in this this
way

the the only only son son of of the the deceased was was then then called called
and and evidence evidence as as follows had had been been away away from from home home for for
three three days days at at and and had had only only just just upon upon the the
morning morning of of last last the the father father was was absent absent from from home home at at
the the time time of of my my arrival and and was was informed informed by by the the maid maid that that he he
had had driven driven over over to to with with the the groom after after
my my return return heard heard the the wheels wheels of of his his trap trap in in the the yard and
looking looking out out of of my my window saw saw him him get get out out and and walk walk out out
of of the the yard though though was was not not aware aware in in which which direction direction he he was was
going then then my my gun gun and and out out in in the the direction direction of of
the the with with the the intention intention of of visiting visiting the the rabbit rabbit
warren warren which which is is upon upon the the other other side my my way way saw saw
the the gamekeeper as as he he had had stated stated in in his his evidence but but
he he is is mistaken mistaken in in thinking thinking that that was was following following my my father had had
no no idea idea that that he he was was in in front front of of me about about a a hundred hundred
from from the the pool pool heard heard a a cry cry of of which which was was a a usual usual signal signal
between between my my father father and and myself then then hurried hurried forward and and found found
him him standing standing by by the the pool to to be be much much surprised surprised at at
seeing seeing me me and and asked asked me me rather rather roughly roughly what what was was doing doing there
conversation conversation which which led led to to high high words words and and almost almost to to blows
for for my my father father was was a a man man of of a a very very violent violent temper that that his his
passion passion was was becoming becoming ungovernable left left him him and and
towards towards had had not not gone gone more more than than
however when when heard heard a a hideous hideous outcry outcry behind behind me which which caused caused me me
to to run run back back again found found my my father father upon upon the the ground
with with his his head head terribly terribly injured dropped dropped my my gun gun and and held held him him in in
my my arms but but he he almost almost expired beside beside him him for for
some some minutes and and then then made made my my way way to to
his his house house being being the the nearest to to ask ask for for assistance saw saw no no one one
near near my my father father when when and and have have no no idea idea how how he he came came by by
his his was was not not a a popular popular man being being somewhat somewhat cold cold and and
forbidding forbidding in in his his manners but but he he had as as far far as as know no no
active active know know nothing nothing further further of of the the matter

a a few few words but but could could only only catch catch some some
allusion allusion to to a a rat

did did you you understand understand by by that

conveyed conveyed no no meaning meaning to to me thought thought that that he he was was
delirious

was was the the point point upon upon which which you you and and your your father father
had had this this final final quarrel

should should prefer prefer not not to to answer

am am afraid afraid that that must must press press it

is is really really impossible impossible for for me me to to tell tell you can can
assure assure you you that that it it has has nothing nothing to to do do with with the the sad sad tragedy tragedy which which


is is for for the the court court to to decide need need not not point point
out out to to you you that that your your refusal refusal to to answer answer will will prejudice prejudice your your case case
in in any any future future proceedings proceedings which which may may arise

you you see see nothing nothing which which aroused aroused your your suspicions suspicions
when when you you on on hearing hearing the the cry cry and and found found your your father father
fatally fatally injured

the the examination examination of of the the witness

see said said as as down down the the column that the the coroner coroner
in in his his concluding concluding was was rather rather severe severe upon upon young young
calls calls attention and and with with reason to to the the discrepancy discrepancy about about his his
father father having having to to him him before before seeing seeing him also also to to his his
refusal refusal to to give give details details of of his his conversation conversation with with his his father and and
his his singular singular account account of of his his fathers dying dying words are are all
as as he he very very much much against against the the son

softly softly to to himself himself and and stretched stretched himself himself out out upon upon
the the cushioned cushioned seat you you and and the the coroner coroner have have been been at at some some
pains said said he to single single out out the the very very strongest strongest points points in in the the
young young mans you you see see that that you you alternately alternately give give him him
credit credit for for having having too too much much imagination imagination and and too too little
little if if he he could could not not invent invent a a cause cause of of quarrel quarrel which which would would
give give him him the the sympathy sympathy of of the the jury too too much if if he he evolved evolved from from
his his own own inner inner consciousness consciousness anything anything so so as as a a dying dying
reference reference to to a a rat and and the the incident incident of of the the vanishing vanishing cloth
sir shall shall approach approach this this case case from from the the point point of of view view that that what what
this this young young man man is is true and and we we shall shall see see whither whither that that
hypothesis hypothesis will will lead lead us now now here here is is my my pocket pocket and and
not not another another word word shall shall say say of of this this case case until until we we are are on on the the
scene scene of of action lunch lunch at at and and see see that that we we shall shall be be
there there in in twenty twenty minutes

was was nearly nearly four four o'clock oclock when when we we at at last after after passing passing through through
the the beautiful beautiful and and over over the the broad broad
found found ourselves ourselves at at the the pretty pretty little little of of
lean man furtive furtive and and was was waiting waiting for for
us us upon upon the the platform spite spite of of the the light light brown brown and and
which which he he in in deference deference to to his his rustic rustic
surroundings had had no no difficulty difficulty in in of of
him him we we drove drove to to the the where where a a
room room had had already already been been engaged engaged for for us

have have ordered ordered a a carriage said said as as we we sat sat over over a a cup cup
of of tea your your energetic energetic nature and and that that you you would would not not be be
happy happy until until you you had had been been on on the the scene scene of of the the crime

was was very very nice nice and and complimentary complimentary of of you
is is entirely entirely a a question question of of barometric barometric pressure

startled do do not not quite quite follow he he said

is is the the glass see wind and and not not a a cloud cloud
in in the the sky have have a a of of here here which which need need
smoking and and the the sofa sofa is is very very much much superior superior to to the the usual usual country country
hotel hotel abomination do do not not think think that that it it is is probable probable that that
shall shall use use the the carriage carriage tonight

indulgently have no no doubt already already formed formed

walked walked down down to to the the station station with with them and and then then through through
the the streets streets of of the the little little town finally finally returning returning to to the the hotel
where where lay lay upon upon the the sofa sofa and and tried tried to to interest interest myself myself in in a a
novel puny puny plot plot of of the the story story was was so so thin
however when when compared compared to to the the deep deep mystery mystery through through which which we we were were
groping and and found found my my attention attention wander wander so so continually continually from from the the
action action to to the the fact that that at at last last it it across across the the room room and and
myself myself up up entirely entirely to to a a consideration consideration of of the the events events of of the the
day that that this this unhappy unhappy young young mans story story were were
absolutely absolutely true then then what what hellish hellish thing what what absolutely absolutely
unforeseen unforeseen and and extraordinary extraordinary calamity calamity could could have have occurred occurred between between
the the time time when when he he parted parted from from his his father and and the the moment moment when
drawn drawn back back by by his his he he into into the the glade was was
something something terrible terrible and and deadly could could it it be not not the the
nature nature of of the the reveal reveal something something to to my my medical medical
the the bell bell and and called called for for the the weekly weekly county county paper which which
contained contained a a verbatim verbatim account account of of the the inquest the the
deposition deposition it it was was stated stated that that the the posterior posterior third third of of the the left left
parietal parietal bone bone and and the the left left half half of of the the occipital occipital bone bone had had been been
shattered shattered by by a a heavy heavy blow blow from from a a blunt blunt weapon marked marked the the spot spot
upon upon my my own own head such such a a blow blow must must have have been been struck struck from from
behind was was to to some some extent extent in in of of the the accused as as when when
seen seen quarrelling quarrelling he he was was face face to to face face with with his his father it it
did did not not go go for for very very much for for the the older older man man might might have have turned turned his his
back back before before the the blow blow fell it it might might be be worth worth while while to to call call
attention attention to to it there there was was the the peculiar peculiar dying dying
reference reference to to a a rat could could that that mean could could not not be be
delirium man man dying dying from from a a sudden sudden blow blow does does not not commonly commonly become become
delirious it it was was more more likely likely to to be be an an attempt attempt to to explain explain how how
he he met met his his fate what what could could it it indicate my my
brains brains to to find find some some possible possible explanation then then the the incident incident
of of the the grey grey cloth cloth seen seen by by young young that that were were true true the the
murderer murderer must must have have dropped dropped some some part part of of his his dress presumably presumably his his
overcoat in in his his flight and and must must have have had had the the hardihood hardihood to to
return return and and to to carry carry it it away away at at the the instant instant when when the the son son was was
kneeling kneeling with with his his back back turned turned not not a a dozen dozen paces paces off a a
tissue tissue of of and and the the whole whole thing thing was
did did not not wonder wonder at at opinion and and yet yet had had so so much much faith faith
in in insight insight that that could could not not lose lose hope hope as as long long
as as every every fresh fresh fact fact to to strengthen strengthen his his conviction conviction of of young young
innocence

was was late late before before came came back back alone
for for was was in in in in the the town

glass glass still still keeps keeps very very high he he as as he he sat sat down
is is of of importance importance that that it it should should not not rain rain before before we we are are able able
to to go go over over the the ground the the other other hand a a man man should should be be at at his his
very very best best and and for for such such nice nice work work as as that and and did did not not
wish wish to to do do it it when when by by a a long long journey have have seen seen young young


what what did did you you learn learn from from him



he he throw throw no no light

at at all was was inclined inclined to to think think at at one one time time that that he he
who who had had done done it it and and was was screening screening him him or or her but but am am convinced convinced
now now that that he he is is as as puzzled puzzled as as everyone everyone else is is not not a a very very
quick-witted quickwitted youth though though comely comely to to look look at at and should should think
sound sound at at heart

cannot cannot admire admire his his taste if it it is is indeed indeed a a fact fact
that that he he was was averse averse to to a a marriage marriage with with so so charming charming a a young young lady lady as as
this this

thereby thereby hangs hangs a a rather rather painful painful tale fellow fellow is is madly
insanely in in love love with with her but but some some two two years years ago when when he he was was
only only a a lad and and before before he he really really her for for she she had had been been away away
five five years years at at a a what what does does the the idiot idiot do do but but get get
into into the the clutches clutches of of a a barmaid barmaid in in and and marry marry her her at at a a
registry registry office one one knows knows a a word word of of the the matter but but you you can can
imagine imagine how how it it must must be be to to him him to to be be for for not not
doing doing what what he he would would give give his his very very eyes eyes to to do but but what what he he knows knows
to to be be absolutely absolutely impossible was was sheer sheer frenzy frenzy of of this this sort sort
which which made made him him throw throw his his hands hands up up into into the the air air when when his his father
at at their their last last interview was was him him on on to to propose propose to to
the the other other hand he he had had no no means means of of supporting supporting himself
and and his his father who who was was by by all all accounts accounts a a very very hard hard man would would
have have thrown thrown him him over over utterly utterly had had he he known known the the truth was was with with
his his barmaid barmaid wife wife that that he he had had spent spent the the last last three three days days in in
and and his his father father did did not not know know where where he he was that that
point is is of of importance has has come come out out of of evil however
for for the the barmaid finding finding from from the the papers papers that that he he is is in in serious serious
trouble trouble and and likely likely to to be be hanged has has thrown thrown him him over over utterly utterly and and
has has written written to to him him to to say say that that she she has has a a husband husband already already in in the the
so so that that there there is is really really no no tie tie between between them
think think that that that that bit bit of of news news has has young young for for all all
that that he he has has

if if he he is is innocent who who has has done done it

who would would call call your your attention attention very very particularly particularly to to two two
points is is that that the the murdered murdered man man had had an an appointment appointment with with
at at the the pool and and that that the the could could not not have have been been his his
son for for his his son son was was away and and he he did did not not know know when when he he would would
return second second is is that that the the murdered murdered man man was was heard heard to to cry cry
before before he he that that his his son son had had are are the the
crucial crucial points points upon upon which which the the case case now now let let us us talk talk
about about if if you you please and and we we shall shall leave leave all all
minor minor matters matters until until tomorrow

was was no no rain as as had had and and the the morning morning broke broke
bright bright and and cloudless nine nine o'clock oclock called called for for us us with with
the the carriage and and we we set set off off for for and and the the


is is serious serious news news this this morning observed is is
said said that that of of the the is is so so ill ill that that his his life life is is
of

elderly elderly man presume said said

sixty but but his his constitution constitution has has been been shattered shattered by by his his life life
abroad and and he he has has been been in in failing failing health health for for some some time
business business has has had had a a very very bad bad effect effect upon upon him was was an an old old friend friend
of of and may may add a a great great benefactor benefactor to to him for for
have have learned learned that that he he him him rent rent free

is is interesting said said

yes a a hundred hundred other other ways ways he he has has helped helped him
about about here here speaks speaks of of his his kindness kindness to to him

it it not not strike strike you you as as a a little little singular singular that that this this
who who to to have have had had little little of of his his own and and to to have have
been been under under such such obligations obligations to to should should still still talk talk of of
his his son son to to daughter who who is presumably
heiress heiress to to the the estate and and that that in in such such a a very very manner
as as if if it it were were merely merely a a case case of of a a proposal proposal and and all all else else would would
follow is is the the more more strange since since we we know know that that himself himself
was was averse averse to to the the idea daughter daughter told told us us as as much you you not not
deduce deduce something something from from that

have have to to the the and and the the said said
winking winking at at me find find it it hard hard enough enough to to tackle tackle facts
without without flying flying away away after after theories theories and and fancies

are are right said said demurely you do do find find it it very very hard hard
to to tackle tackle the the facts

have have one one fact fact which which you you seem seem to to find find it it
difficult difficult to to get get hold hold of with with some some warmth

that that is

senior senior met met his his death death from from junior junior and and that that
all all theories theories to to the the contrary contrary are are the the moonshine

moonshine moonshine is is a a thing thing than than fog said said
laughing am am very very much much mistaken mistaken if if this this is is not not
upon upon the the left

that that is is it was was a a widespread
building with with great great yellow yellow blotches blotches
of of lichen lichen upon upon the the grey grey walls drawn drawn blinds blinds and and the the smokeless smokeless
however it it a a stricken stricken look as as though though the the weight weight
of of this this horror horror still still lay lay heavy heavy upon upon it called called at at the the door
when when the the maid at at request us us the the boots boots which which her her
master master at at the the time time of of his his death and and also also a a pair pair of of the the
sons though though not not the the pair pair which which he he had had then then had measured measured
these these very very carefully carefully from from seven seven or or eight eight different different points
desired desired to to be be led led to to the the courtyard from from which which we we all all
the the winding winding track track which which led led to to

was was transformed transformed when when he he was was hot hot upon upon such such a a scent scent
as as this who who had had only only known known the the quiet quiet thinker thinker and and logician logician of of
would would have have failed failed to to him face face flushed flushed
and and darkened brows brows were were drawn drawn into into two two hard hard black black lines
while while his his eyes eyes out out from from beneath beneath them them with with a a steely steely glitter
face face was was bent bent downward his his shoulders shoulders bowed his his lips lips
compressed and and the the veins veins stood stood out out like like whipcord whipcord in in his his long
sinewy sinewy neck nostrils nostrils to to dilate dilate with with a a purely purely animal animal
lust lust for for the the chase and and his his mind mind was was so so absolutely absolutely concentrated concentrated
upon upon the the matter matter before before him him that that a a question question or or remark remark fell fell
unheeded unheeded upon upon his his ears or at at the the most only only a a quick
impatient impatient snarl snarl in in reply and and silently silently he he made made his his way way
along along the the track track which which through through the the and and so so by by way way of of
the the woods woods to to the the was was damp marshy marshy ground as as is is
all all that that district and and there there were were marks marks of of many many feet both both upon upon
the the path path and and amid amid the the short short grass grass which which bounded bounded it it on on either either
side would would hurry hurry on sometimes sometimes stop stop dead and and
once once he he made made quite quite a a little little detour detour into into the the meadow and and
walked walked behind behind him the the detective detective indifferent indifferent and and contemptuous
while while watched watched my my friend friend with with the the interest interest which which from from the the
conviction conviction that that every every one one of of his his actions actions was was directed directed towards towards a a
definite definite end

which which is is a a little little sheet sheet of of water water
some some fifty fifty across is is situated situated at at the the boundary boundary between between the the
and and the the private private park park of of the the wealthy wealthy
the the woods woods which which lined lined it it upon upon the the farther farther side side we we could could see see
the the red jutting jutting which which marked marked the the site site of of the the rich rich
dwelling the the side side of of the the pool pool the the woods woods
very very thick and and there there was was a a narrow narrow belt belt of of sodden sodden grass grass
twenty twenty paces paces across across between between the the edge edge of of the the trees trees and and the the
which which lined lined the the lake us us the the exact exact spot spot at at which which
the the body body had had been been found and indeed so so moist moist was was the the ground
that that could could plainly plainly see see the the traces traces which which had had been been left left by by the the
fall fall of of the the stricken stricken man as as could could see see by by his his eager eager
face face and and eyes very very many many other other things things were were to to be be read read
upon upon the the trampled trampled grass round like like a a dog dog who who is is picking picking
up up a a scent and and then then turned turned upon upon my my companion

did did you you go go into into the the pool pool for he he asked

about about with with a a rake thought thought there there might might be be some some weapon weapon
or or other other trace how how on on earth

tut tut have have no no time left left foot foot of of yours yours with with its its
inward inward twist twist is is all all over over the the place mole mole could could trace trace it and and
there there it it among among the the how how simple simple it it would would all all
have have been been had had been been here here before before they they came came like like a a herd herd of of buffalo buffalo
and and all all over over it is is where where the the party party with with the the
came and and they they have have covered covered all all tracks tracks for for six six or or
eight eight feet feet round round the the body here here are are three three separate separate tracks tracks of of
the the same same feet out out a a lens lens and and lay lay down down upon upon his his
waterproof waterproof to to have have a a better better view talking talking all all the the time time rather rather to to
himself himself than than to to us are are young young feet he he
was was walking and and once once he he swiftly so so that that the the are are
deeply deeply marked marked and and the the heels heels hardly hardly visible out out his his
story when when he he saw saw his his father father on on the the ground here here are are
the the fathers feet feet as as he he paced paced up up and and down is is this then
is is the the of of the the gun gun as as the the son son stood stood listening this
ha have have we we here too quite quite
unusual unusual boots come they they go they they come come course course
that that was was for for the the cloak where where did did they they come come from up up
and and down sometimes sometimes losing sometimes sometimes finding finding the the track track until until we we
were were well well within within the the edge edge of of the the wood wood and and under under the the shadow shadow of of a a
great great beech the the largest largest tree tree in in the the
his his way way to to the the farther farther side side of of this this and and lay lay down down once once more more upon upon
his his face face with with a a little little cry cry of of satisfaction a a long long time time he he
there turning turning over over the the leaves leaves and and dried dried sticks
gathering gathering up up what what to to me me to to be be dust dust into into an an envelope envelope and and
with with his his lens lens not not only only the the ground ground but but even even the the bark bark of of
the the tree tree as as far far as as he he could could reach jagged jagged stone stone was was lying lying among among
the the moss and and this this also also he he carefully carefully and and retained
he he a a pathway pathway through through the the wood wood until until he he came came to to the the
highroad where where all all traces traces were were lost

has has been been a a case case of of considerable considerable interest he he
returning returning to to his his natural natural manner fancy fancy that that this this grey grey house house on on
the the right right must must be be the the lodge think think that that will will go go in in and and have have a a
word word with with and and perhaps perhaps write write a a little little note done done
that we we may may drive drive back back to to our our luncheon may may walk walk to to the the cab
and and shall shall be be with with you you presently

was was about about ten ten minutes minutes before before we we our our cab cab and and drove drove
back back into into still still carrying carrying with with him him the the stone stone which which he he
had had picked picked up up in in the the wood

may may interest interest you he he holding holding it it out
murder murder was was done done with with it

see see no no marks

are are none

do do you you know then

grass grass was was growing growing under under it had had only only lain lain there there a a few few
days was was no no sign sign of of a a place place whence whence it it had had been been taken
with with the the is is no no sign sign of of any any other other
weapon

the the murderer

a a tall tall man lefthanded with with the the right right leg wears wears
and and a a grey grey cloak
a a and and a a blunt blunt penknife in in his his
pocket are are several several other other but but these these may may be be
enough enough to to aid aid us us in in our our search

am am afraid afraid that that am am still still a a he he
said are are all all very very well but but we we have have to to deal deal with with a a
hardheaded jury

verrons calmly work work your your own own
method and and shall shall work work mine shall shall be be busy busy this this afternoon
and and shall shall probably probably return return to to by by the the evening evening train

leave leave your your case case unfinished

finished

the the mystery

is is solved

was was the the criminal then

gentleman gentleman describe

who who is is he

it it would would not not be be difficult difficult to to find find out is is not not such such a a
populous populous

his his shoulders am am a a practical practical man he he said
and really really cannot cannot undertake undertake to to go go about about the the country country looking looking
for for a a left-handed lefthanded gentleman gentleman with with a a game game leg should should become become the the
laughingstock of of

right said said quietly have have given given you you the the chance
are are your your shall shall drop drop you you a a line line before before
leave

left left at at his his rooms we we drove drove to to our our hotel where where
we we found found lunch lunch upon upon the the table was was silent silent and and buried buried in in
thought thought with with a a pained pained expression expression upon upon his his face as as one one who who finds finds
himself himself in in a a perplexing perplexing position

here he he said said when when the the cloth cloth was was cleared cleared just sit sit
down down in in this this chair chair and and let let me me preach preach to to you you for for a a little don't dont
know know quite quite what what to to do and and should should value value your your advice a a
cigar cigar and and let let me me expound

do do so

now in in considering considering this this case case there there are are two two points points about about
young young narrative narrative which which struck struck us us both both
although although they they impressed impressed me me in in his his and and you you against against him
was was the the fact fact that that his his father father should according according to to his his account
cry cry before before seeing seeing him other other was was his his singular singular dying dying
reference reference to to a a rat several several words you you understand but but
that that was was all all that that caught caught the the sons ear from from this this double double
point point our our research research must must commence and and we we will will begin begin it it by by
that that what what the the lad lad is is absolutely absolutely true

of of this this then

obviously obviously it it could could not not have have been been meant meant for for the the son
son as as far far as as he he was was in in was was mere mere chance chance that that
he he was was within within earshot was was meant meant to to attract attract the the
attention attention of of it it was was that that he he had had the the appointment appointment with
is is a a distinctly distinctly cry and and one one which which is is used used
between between is is a a strong strong presumption presumption that that the the
person person whom whom expected expected to to meet meet him him at at was was
who who had had been been in in

of of the the rat then

a a folded folded paper paper from from his his pocket pocket and and
it it out out on on the the table is is a a map map of of the the of of
he he said wired wired to to for for it it last last night put put his his hand hand
over over part part of of the the map do do you you read

read

now raised raised his his hand



so was was the the word word the the man man uttered and and of of which which his his
son son only only caught caught the the last last two two syllables was was trying trying to to utter utter
the the name name of of his his murderer and and so of of

is is wonderful

is is obvious now you you see had had narrowed narrowed the the field field down down
possession possession of of a a grey grey garment garment was was a a third third point point
which the the sons statement statement to to be be correct was was a a
certainty have have come come now now out out of of mere mere vagueness vagueness to to the the definite definite
conception conception of of an an from from with with a a grey grey cloak



one one who who was was at at home home in in the the district for for the the pool pool can can only only
be be by by the the farm farm or or by by the the estate where where could could
hardly hardly wander

so

comes comes our our expedition expedition of of today an an examination examination of of the the
ground ground the the trifling trifling details details which which to to that that
imbecile imbecile as as to to the the personality personality of of the the criminal

how how did did you you gain gain them

know know my my method is is founded founded upon upon the the observation observation of of
trifles

height height know know that that you you might might roughly roughly judge judge from from the the length length
of of his his stride boots too might might be be told told from from their their traces

they they were were peculiar peculiar boots

his his lameness

impression impression of of his his right right foot foot was was always always less less distinct distinct than than
his his left put put less less weight weight upon upon it he he
was was lame

his his

were were yourself yourself struck struck by by the the nature nature of of the the injury injury as as recorded recorded
by by the the surgeon surgeon at at the the inquest blow blow was was struck struck from from
immediately immediately behind and and yet yet was was upon upon the the left left side how how can can
that that be be unless unless it it were were by by a a left-handed lefthanded man had had stood stood behind behind
that that tree tree during during the the interview interview between between the the father father and and son had had
even even smoked smoked there found found the the ash ash of of a a cigar which which my my special special
knowledge knowledge of of tobacco tobacco ashes ashes me me to to pronounce pronounce as as an an
cigar have as as you you know devoted devoted some some attention attention to to this and and
written written a a little little monograph monograph on on the the ashes ashes of of different different
of of pipe cigar and and cigarette cigarette tobacco found found the the
ash then then round round and and discovered discovered the the stump stump among among the the moss moss
where where he he had had it was was an an cigar of of the the variety variety
which which are are rolled rolled in in

the the

could could see see that that the the end end had had not not been been in in his his mouth he he
used used a a holder tip tip had had been been cut cut off not not bitten bitten off but but the the
cut cut was was not not a a clean clean one so so a a blunt blunt penknife

said you have have drawn drawn a a net net round round this this man man from from which which
he he cannot cannot escape and and you you have have saved saved an an innocent innocent human human life life as as
truly truly as as if if you you had had cut cut the the cord cord which which was was hanging hanging him see see the the
direction direction in in which which all all this this points culprit culprit is

the the hotel hotel waiter opening opening the the door door of of
our our and and in in a a visitor

man man who who entered entered was was a a strange strange and and impressive impressive figure
slow step step and and bowed bowed shoulders shoulders the the appearance appearance of of
decrepitude and and yet yet his his hard craggy craggy features and and
his his enormous enormous limbs limbs that that he he was was possessed possessed of of unusual unusual
strength strength of of body body and and of of character tangled tangled beard grizzled grizzled
hair and and outstanding drooping drooping combined combined to to give give an an air air
of of dignity dignity and and power power to to his his appearance but but his his face face was was of of an an
ashen ashen white while while his his lips lips and and the the corners corners of of his his nostrils nostrils were were
with with a a shade shade of of blue was was clear clear to to me me at at a a glance glance that that
he he was was in in the the grip grip of of some some deadly deadly and and chronic chronic disease

sit sit down down on on the the sofa said said gently had had my my
note

see see me me here here to to avoid avoid scandal

glance glance over over my my notes notes and and records records of of the the
between between the the years years and and am am faced faced by by so so many many which which
present present strange strange and and interesting interesting features features that that it it is is no no easy easy
matter matter to to know know which which to to choose choose and and which which to to leave however
have have already already publicity publicity through through the the papers and and others others have have
not not offered offered a a field field for for those those peculiar peculiar qualities qualities which which my my friend friend
possessed possessed in in so so high high a a degree and and which which it it is is the the object object of of
these these papers papers to to illustrate too have have baffled baffled his his
analytical analytical skill and and would would be as as beginnings beginnings without without
an an ending while while others others have have been been but but partially partially cleared cleared up and and
have have their their founded founded rather rather upon upon conjecture conjecture and and
surmise surmise than than on on that that absolute absolute logical logical proof proof which which was was so so dear dear to to
him is however one one of of these these last last which which was was so so remarkable remarkable
in in its its details details and and so so startling startling in in its its results results that that am am
to to give give some some account account of of it it in in spite spite of of the the fact fact that that there there are are
points points in in connection connection with with it it which which never never have have been and and probably probably
never never will will be entirely entirely cleared cleared up

year year furnished furnished us us with with a a long long series series of of of of greater greater
or or less less interest of of which which retain retain the the records my my

poisoning poisoning case the the latter as as may may be be remembered
was was able by by winding winding up up the the dead dead mans watch to to
prove prove that that it it had had been been wound wound up up two two hours hours before and and that that
therefore therefore the the deceased deceased had had gone gone to to bed bed within within that that
deduction deduction which which was was of of the the greatest greatest importance importance in in clearing clearing up up the the
case these these may may sketch sketch out out at at some some future future date but but none none of of
them them present present such such singular singular features features as as the the strange strange train train of of
circumstances circumstances which which have have now now taken taken up up my my pen pen to to describe

foul-mouthed foulmouthed when when he he was was angry and and of of a a most most retiring retiring
disposition all all the the years years that that he he lived lived at at

through through the the keyhole but but was was never never able able to to see see more more than than such such a a
collection collection of of old old and and bundles bundles as as would would be be expected expected in in such such
a a room

was was in in letter letter with with a a foreign foreign stamp stamp
lay lay upon upon the the table table in in front front of of the the plate was was not not a a

of of his his face lip lip had had fallen his his eyes eyes were were his his
skin skin the the of of putty and and he he at at the the envelope envelope which which he he
still still held held in in his his trembling trembling hand he he shrieked and and
then my my my my sins sins have have overtaken overtaken me

said said he and and rising rising from from the the table table he he retired retired to to his his
room leaving leaving me me with with horror up up the the envelope envelope
and and saw saw scrawled scrawled in in red red ink ink upon upon the the inner inner flap just just above above the the
gum the the letter letter three three times times repeated was was nothing nothing else else
save save the the five five dried dried could could be be the the reason reason of of his his
overpowering overpowering terror left left the the and and as as
the the stair stair met met him him coming coming down down with with an an old old rusty rusty key
which which must must have have to to the the attic in in one one hand and and a a small small
brass brass box like like a a cashbox in in the the other

may may do do what what they they like but but checkmate checkmate them them still
said said he he with with an an oath that that shall shall want want a a fire fire in in my my
room room today and and send send down down to to the the lawyer

did did as as he he ordered and and when when the the lawyer lawyer was was asked asked to to
step step up up to to the the room fire fire was was burning burning and and in in the the
grate grate there there was was a a mass mass of of black fluffy fluffy ashes as as of of burned burned
paper while while the the brass brass box box stood stood open open and and empty empty beside beside it
at at the the box box noticed with with a a start that that upon upon the the lid lid was was
printed printed the the treble treble which which had had read read in in the the morning morning upon upon the the
envelope

wish wish you said said my my uncle to witness witness my my will leave leave

where where you

signed signed the the paper paper as as directed and and the the lawyer lawyer it it away away with with
him singular singular incident incident made as as you you may may think the the deepest deepest
impression impression upon upon me and and over over it it and and turned turned it it every every
way way in in my my mind mind without without being being able able to to make make anything anything of of it
could could not not shake shake off off the the vague vague feeling feeling of of dread dread which which it it left left
behind though though the the sensation sensation less less keen keen as as the the passed passed
and and nothing nothing to to disturb disturb the the usual usual routine routine of of our our lives
could could see see a a change change in in my my uncle however more more than than ever
and and he he was was less less inclined inclined for for any any sort sort of of society of of his his
time time he he would would spend spend in in his his room with with the the door door upon upon the the
inside but but sometimes sometimes he he would would emerge emerge in in a a sort sort of of drunken drunken frenzy frenzy
and and would would burst burst out out of of the the house house and and tear tear about about the the garden garden with with a a
revolver revolver in in his his hand screaming screaming out out that that he he was was afraid afraid of of no no man
and and that that he he was was not not to to be be up like like a a sheep sheep in in a a pen by by
man man or or devil these these hot hot fits fits were were over however he he would would
rush rush tumultuously tumultuously in in at at the the door door and and lock lock and and bar bar it it behind behind him
like like a a man man who who can can brazen brazen it it out out no no longer longer against against the the terror terror
which which lies lies at at the the roots roots of of his his soul such such times times have have seen seen
his his face even even on on a a cold cold day glisten glisten with with moisture as as though though it it
were were new new raised raised from from a a basin

to to come come to to an an end end of of the the matter and and not not to to
abuse abuse your your patience there there came came a a night night when when he he made made one one of of those those
drunken drunken from from which which he he never never came came back found found him when when
we we to to search search for for him face face downward downward in in a a little little
pool which which lay lay at at the the foot foot of of the the garden
was was no no sign sign of of any any violence and and the the water water was was but but two two feet feet deep
so so that that the the jury having having regard regard to to his his known known eccentricity
brought brought in in a a verdict verdict of of suicide who who how how he he
from from the the very very thought thought of of death had had much much ado ado to to persuade persuade myself myself
that that he he had had gone gone out out of of his his way way to to meet meet it matter matter passed
however and and my my father father entered entered into into possession possession of of the the estate and and
of of some some pounds which which lay lay to to his his credit credit at at the the bank

with with and and papers shall shall take take no no notice notice of of such such
nonsense

should should certainly certainly speak speak to to the the police said

be be at at for for my my pains of of the the sort

let let me me do do so

forbid forbid you won't wont have have a a fuss fuss made made about about such such
nonsense

was was in in vain vain to to argue argue with with him for for he he was was a a very very obstinate obstinate
man about however with with a a heart heart which which was was full full of of


the the third third day day after after the the coming coming of of the the letter letter my my father father
from from home home to to visit visit an an old old friend friend of of his who who is is
in in command command of of one one of of the the upon upon was was glad glad
that that he he should should go for for it it to to me me that that he he was was farther farther from from
danger danger when when he he was was away away from from home that however was was in in
error the the second second day day of of his his absence absence received received a a telegram telegram
from from the the major me me to to come come at at once father father had had
fallen fallen over over one one of of the the deep deep which which abound abound in in the the
and and was was lying lying senseless with with a a shattered shattered skull
hurried hurried to to him but but he he passed passed away away without without having having ever ever
his his consciousness had as as it it been been returning returning from from
in in the the twilight and and as as the the country country was was unknown unknown to to him
and and the the chalkpit unfenced the the jury jury had had no no hesitation hesitation in in
bringing bringing in in a a verdict verdict of of death from from accidental accidental causes
as as every every fact fact connected connected with with his his death
was was unable unable to to find find anything anything which which could could suggest suggest the the idea idea of of
murder were were no no signs signs of of violence no no no no
robbery no no record record of of having having been been seen seen upon upon the the roads
yet yet need need not not tell tell you you that that my my mind mind was was far far from from at at ease
and and that that was was wellnigh certain certain that that some some foul foul plot plot had had been been
woven woven round round him

this this sinister sinister way way came came into into my my inheritance will will ask ask me me
why why did did not not dispose dispose of of it answer because because was was well well
convinced convinced that that our our troubles troubles were were in in some some way way dependent dependent upon upon an an
incident incident in in my my uncles life and and that that the the danger danger would would be be as as
pressing pressing in in one one house house as as in in another

was was in in that that my my poor poor father father met met his his end and and two two
years years and and eight eight months months have have elapsed elapsed since since then that that time time
have have lived lived happily happily at at and and had had begun begun to to hope hope that that
this this curse curse had had passed passed away away from from the the family and and that that it it had had ended ended
with with the the last last generation had had begun begun to to take take comfort comfort too too soon
however yesterday yesterday morning morning the the blow blow fell fell in in the the very very shape shape in in
which which it it had had come come upon upon my my father

young young man man from from his his waistcoat waistcoat a a crumpled crumpled envelope and and
turning turning to to the the table table he he shook shook out out upon upon it it five five little little dried dried
orange orange

is is the the envelope he he continued postmark postmark is is
division are are the the very very words words which which were were
upon upon my my fathers last last message and and then then the the
papers papers on on the the sundial

tell tell the the his his face face into into his his thin white white
have have felt felt helpless have have felt felt like like one one of of those those poor poor
when when the the snake snake is is towards towards it seem seem to to be be in in
the the grasp grasp of of some some resistless inexorable inexorable evil which which no no foresight foresight

tut must must act man or or you you are are
lost but but energy energy can can save save you is is no no time time for for
despair

have have seen seen the the police



they they listened listened to to my my story story with with a a smile am am convinced convinced that that
the the inspector inspector has has formed formed the the opinion opinion that that the the letters letters are are all all
practical practical jokes and and that that the the deaths deaths of of my my relations relations were were really really
accidents as as the the jury jury stated and and were were not not to to be be connected connected with with
the the

shook shook his his clenched clenched hands hands in in the the air
imbecility he he

have however allowed allowed me me a a policeman who who may may remain remain in in
the the house house with with me

he he come come with with you you tonight

orders orders were were to to stay stay in in the the house

in in the the air

did did you you come come to to me he he and above above all why why did did you you
not not come come at at once

did did not not know was was only only today that that spoke spoke to to
about about my my troubles troubles and and was was advised advised by by him him to to come come to to
you

is is really really two two days days since since you you had had the the letter should should have have
acted acted before before this have have no no further further evidence suppose than than
that that which which you you have have placed placed before before suggestive suggestive detail detail which which
might might help help us

is is one one thing said said in in his his coat coat
pocket and drawing drawing out out a a piece piece of of
paper he he laid laid it it out out upon upon the the table have have some some remembrance
said said he that on on the the day day when when my my uncle uncle burned burned the the papers papers
observed observed that that the the small which which lay lay amid amid the the
ashes ashes were were of of this this particular particular found found this this single single sheet sheet
upon upon the the floor floor of of his his room and and am am inclined inclined to to think think that that it it
may may be be one one of of the the papers papers which which has perhaps out out from from
among among the the others and and in in that that way way has has escaped escaped destruction
the the mention mention of of do do not not see see that that it it helps helps us us much think think
myself myself that that it it is is a a page page from from some some private private diary writing writing is is
undoubtedly undoubtedly my my uncles

moved moved the the lamp and and we we both both bent bent over over the the sheet sheet of of paper
which which by by its its ragged ragged edge edge that that it it had had indeed indeed been been torn torn from from
a a book was was headed and and beneath beneath were were the the
following following enigmatical enigmatical

well

you said said up up the the paper paper and and returning returning it it
to to our our visitor now now you you must must on on no no account account lose lose another another
instant cannot cannot spare spare time time even even to to discuss discuss what what you you have have told told
me must must get get home home and and act

is is but but one one thing thing to to do must must be be done done at at once must must
put put this this piece piece of of paper paper which which you you have have shown shown us us into into the the brass brass

you you understand



not not think think of of revenge or or anything anything of of the the sort at at present
think think that that we we may may gain gain that that by by means means of of the the law but but we we have have our our
web web to to weave while while theirs theirs is is already already woven first first
consideration consideration is is to to remove remove the the pressing pressing danger danger which which
you second second is is to to clear clear up up the the mystery mystery and and to to punish punish the the
guilty guilty

thank thank you said said the the young young man rising rising and and pulling pulling on on his his

particular shook shook hands hands with with us us and and his his leave
the the wind wind still still and and the the rain rain splashed splashed and and
against against the the windows strange wild wild story story to to have have come come
to to us us from from amid amid the the mad mad in in upon upon us us like like a a sheet sheet
of of seaweed in in a a now now to to have have been been by by them them
once once more

sat sat for for some some time time in in silence with with his his head head sunk sunk
forward forward and and his his eyes eyes bent bent upon upon the the red red glow glow of of the the fire he he
his his pipe and and leaning leaning back back in in his his chair chair he he watched watched the the blue blue
as as they they each each other other up up to to the the ceiling

think he he at at last that of of all all our our we we
have have had had none none more more fantastic fantastic than than this

perhaps the the of of

yes perhaps that yet yet this this seems seems
to to me me to to be be walking walking amid amid even even greater greater than than did did the the


have have you asked formed any any definite definite conception conception as as to to
what what these these are

can can be be no no question question as as to to their their nature he he

what what are are they is is this this and and why why does does he he pursue pursue
this this unhappy unhappy family

closed closed his his eyes eyes and and placed placed his his elbows elbows upon upon the the
arms arms of of his his chair with with his his together ideal ideal
reasoner he he would when when he he had had once once been been shown shown a a
single single fact fact in in all all its its bearings deduce deduce from from it it not not only only all all the the
chain chain of of events events which which led led up up to to it it but but also also all all the the results results which which
would would follow follow from from it could could correctly correctly describe describe a a whole whole
animal animal by by the the contemplation contemplation of of a a single single bone so so the the observer observer who who
has has thoroughly thoroughly understood understood one one link link in in a a series series of of
should should be be able able to to accurately accurately state state all all the the other other ones both both
before before and and after have have not not yet yet the the results results which which the the
reason reason alone alone can can attain attain to may may be be solved solved in in the the study study
which which have have baffled baffled all all those those who who have have sought sought a a solution solution by by the the
aid aid of of their their senses carry carry the the art however to to its its highest highest
pitch it it is is necessary necessary that that the the reasoner reasoner should should be be able able to to
all all the the facts facts which which have have come come to to his his knowledge and and this this
in in itself itself as as you you will will readily readily see a a possession possession of of all all
knowledge which even even in in these these days days of of free free education education and and
is is a a somewhat somewhat rare rare accomplishment is is not not so so
impossible however that that a a man man should should possess possess all all knowledge knowledge
which which is is likely likely to to be be useful useful to to him him in in his his work and and this this have have
in in my my case case to to do remember remember rightly you you on on one one
occasion in in the the early early days days of of our our friendship defined defined my my limits limits
in in a a very very precise precise fashion

laughing was was a a singular singular document
astronomy and and politics politics were were marked marked at at zero
remember variable geology geology profound profound as as regards regards the the
from from any any region region within within fifty fifty of of town chemistry chemistry
eccentric anatomy anatomy unsystematic sensational sensational literature literature and and crime crime
records records unique boxer swordsman lawyer and and
by by cocaine cocaine and and tobacco think were were the the
main main points points of of my my analysis

at at the the last last item he he said say say now as as
said said then that that a a man man should should keep keep his his little little
stocked stocked with with all all the the furniture furniture that that he he is is likely likely to to use and and the the
rest rest he he can can put put away away in in the the of of his his library where where he he
can can get get it it if if he he wants wants it for for such such a a case case as as the the one one which which
has has been been to to us us tonight we we need need certainly certainly to to muster muster
all all our our resources hand hand me me down down the the letter letter of of the the
which which stands stands upon upon the the shelf shelf beside beside you
you let let us us consider consider the the situation situation and and see see what what may may be be
from from it the the first first place we we may may start start with with a a strong strong
presumption presumption that that had had some some very very strong strong reason reason for for
leaving leaving at at his his time time of of life life do do not not change change all all their their
habits habits and and exchange exchange willingly willingly the the charming charming climate climate of of for for
the the lonely lonely life life of of an an provincial provincial town extreme extreme love love
of of solitude solitude in in the the idea idea that that he he was was in in fear fear of of
or or something so so we we may may assume assume as as a a working working hypothesis hypothesis
that that it it was was fear fear of of or or something something which which drove drove him him from from
to to what what it it was was he he we we can can only only deduce deduce that that by by
considering considering the the formidable formidable letters letters which which were were received received by by himself himself
and and his his you you remark remark the the of of those those
letters

first first was was from from the the second second from from and and the the
third third from from

do do you you deduce deduce from from that

are are all all the the writer writer was was on on board board of of a a ship

have have already already a a clue can can be be no no doubt doubt that that
the the strong strong that that the the writer writer was was
on on board board of of a a ship now now let let us us consider consider another another point the the
case case of of seven seven elapsed elapsed between between the the threat threat and and
its its in in it it was was only only some some three three or or four four days
that that suggest suggest anything

greater greater distance distance to to travel

the the letter letter had had also also a a greater greater distance distance to to come

do do not not see see the the point

is is at at least least a a presumption presumption that that the the vessel vessel in in which which the the man man
or or men men are are is is a a looks looks as as if if they they always always send send
their their singular singular warning warning or or token token before before them them when when starting starting upon upon
their their mission see see how how quickly quickly the the deed deed the the sign sign
when when it it came came from from they they had had come come from from in in a a
steamer steamer they they would would have have almost almost as as soon soon as as their their letter
as as a a matter matter of of fact seven seven elapsed think think that that those those
seven seven represented represented the the difference difference between between the the mailboat which which
brought brought the the letter letter and and the the sailing sailing vessel vessel which which brought brought the the
writer

is is possible

than than that is is probable now now you you see see the the deadly deadly
urgency urgency of of this this new new case and and why why young young to to
caution blow blow has has always always fallen fallen at at the the end end of of the the time time which which
it it would would take take the the to to travel travel the the distance this this one one
comes comes from from and and therefore therefore we we cannot cannot count count upon upon delay

can can it it mean this this relentless relentless
persecution

papers papers which which carried carried are are obviously obviously of of vital vital
importance importance to to the the person person or or persons persons in in the the think think
that that it it is is quite quite clear clear that that there there must must be be more more than than one one of of them
single single man man could could not not have have carried carried out out two two deaths deaths in in such such a a way way
as as to to deceive deceive a a jury must must have have been been several several in in
it and and they they must must have have been been men men of of resource resource and and determination
papers papers they they mean mean to to have be be the the holder holder of of them them who who it it may
this this way way you you see see to to be be the the of of an an
individual individual and and the the badge badge of of a a society

of of what what society

the the sound sound produced produced by by a a rifle terrible terrible secret secret
society society was was formed formed by by some some soldiers soldiers in in the the
states states after after the the and and it it formed formed local local
in in different different parts parts of of the the country notably notably in in

unfailingly unfailingly come come upon upon him and and usually usually in in some some strange strange and and
unforeseen unforeseen manner perfect perfect was was the the of of the the

case case upon upon record record where where any any man man in in braving braving it it with with
impunity or or in in which which any any of of its its were were home home to to the the
some some years years the the in in spite spite
of of the the efforts efforts of of the the government government and and of of the the better better
classes classes of of the the community community in in the the in in the the year year
the the movement movement rather rather suddenly suddenly collapsed although although there there have have
been been sporadic sporadic of of the the same same sort sort since since that that date

will will observe said said laying laying down down the the volume that
the the sudden sudden breaking breaking up up of of the the society society was was coincident coincident with with the the
disappearance disappearance of of from from with with their their papers may may
well well have have been been cause cause and and effect is is no no wonder wonder that that he he and and his his
family family have have some some of of the the more more implacable implacable spirits spirits upon upon their their track
can can understand understand that that this this register register and and diary diary may may implicate implicate
some some of of the the first first men men in in the the and and that that there there may may be be many many
who who will will not not sleep sleep easy easy at at night night until until it it is is

the the page page we we have have seen

such such as as we we might might expect if if remember remember right sent
the the to to and and is sent sent the the warning warning to to
them there there are are successive successive that that and and cleared or or
left left the the country and and finally finally that that was was with fear a a
sinister sinister result result for for think that that we we may may let let
some some light light into into this this dark dark place and and believe believe that that the the only only
chance chance young young has has in in the the meantime meantime is is to to do do what what have have
told told him is is nothing nothing more more to to be be said said or or to to be be done done
tonight so so hand hand me me over over my my violin violin and and let let us us try try to to forget forget for for
half half an an hour hour the the miserable miserable weather weather and and the the still still more more miserable miserable

trouble to to me me as as a a doctor to to my my wife wife as as an an old old friend friend
and and school school companion and and comforted comforted her her by by such such words words
as as we we could could find she she know know where where her her husband husband was it it
possible possible that that we we could could bring bring him him back back to to her

seems seems that that it it was had had the the information information that that of of late late
he he had when when the the fit fit was was on on him made made use use of of an an opium opium den den in in the the
farthest farthest east east of of the the his his orgies orgies had had always always been been
confined confined to to one one day and and he he had had come come back and and
shattered in in the the evening now now the the spell spell had had been been upon upon him him
hours and and he he lay lay there doubtless doubtless among among the the
dregs dregs of of the the breathing breathing in in the the poison poison or or sleeping sleeping off off the the
effects he he was was to to be be found she she was was sure sure of of it at at the the
of of in in what what was was she she to to do could could
she a a young young and and timid timid woman make make her her way way into into such such a a place place and and
pluck pluck her her husband husband out out from from among among the the who who surrounded surrounded him

address address which which she she had had given given me so so in in ten ten minutes minutes had had left left
my my armchair armchair and and cheery cheery behind behind me and and was was speeding speeding
eastward eastward in in a a hansom hansom on on a a strange strange errand as as it it to to me me at at
the the time though though the the future future only only could could show show how how strange strange it it was was to to
be

there there was was no no great great difficulty difficulty in in the the first first stage stage of of my my
adventure is is a a vile vile alley alley lurking lurking behind behind the the
high high which which line line the the north north side side of of the the river river to to the the east east
of of a a slopshop and and a a
by by a a steep steep flight flight of of steps steps leading leading down down to to a a black black gap gap like like the the
mouth mouth of of a a cave found found the the den den of of which which was was in in search
my my cab cab to to wait passed passed down down the the steps worn worn hollow hollow in in
the the centre centre by by the the ceaseless ceaseless tread tread of of drunken drunken feet and and by by the the
light light of of a a flickering flickering above above the the door door found found the the latch latch
and and made made my my way way into into a a long low low room thick thick and and heavy heavy with with the the
brown brown opium opium smoke and and with with wooden wooden like like the the
forecastle forecastle of of an an emigrant emigrant ship

the the gloom gloom one one could could dimly dimly catch catch a a glimpse glimpse of of bodies bodies lying lying
in in strange strange fantastic fantastic bowed bowed shoulders bent bent knees heads heads
thrown thrown back and and pointing pointing upward with with here here and and there there a a
dark eye eye turned turned upon upon the the newcomer of of the the black black
shadows shadows there there little little red red circles circles of of light now now bright
now now faint as as the the burning burning poison poison waxed waxed or or in in the the bowls bowls of of
the the metal metal pipes most most lay lay silent but but some some to to
themselves and and others others talked talked together together in in a a strange low
monotonous monotonous voice their their conversation conversation coming coming in in and and then then
suddenly suddenly off off into into silence each each mumbling mumbling out out his his own own
thoughts thoughts and and paying paying little little heed heed to to the the words words of of his his
the the farther farther end end was was a a small small brazier brazier of of burning burning charcoal beside beside
which which on on a a three-legged wooden wooden stool stool there there sat sat a a tall thin thin old old
man with with his his jaw jaw resting resting upon upon his his two two and and his his elbows elbows upon upon
his his knees staring staring into into the the fire

entered a a sallow sallow attendant attendant had had hurried hurried up up with with a a pipe pipe
for for me me and and a a supply supply of of the the drug me me to to an an empty empty berth

you have have not not come come to to stay said said is is a a friend friend
of of mine mine here and and wish wish to to speak speak with with him

was was a a movement movement and and an an exclamation exclamation from from my my right and and
through through the the gloom saw saw pale haggard and and
unkempt staring staring out out at at me

said said he was was in in a a pitiable pitiable state state of of
reaction with with every every nerve nerve in in a a twitter say what what
o'clock oclock is is it

walked walked down down the the narrow narrow passage passage between between the the double double row row of of
sleepers holding holding my my breath breath to to keep keep out out the the vile stupefying stupefying
fumes fumes of of the the drug and and looking looking about about for for the the manager passed passed
the the tall tall man man who who sat sat by by the the brazier brazier felt felt a a sudden sudden pluck pluck at at my my
skirt and and a a low low voice voice whispered past past me and and then then look look
back back at at me words words fell fell quite quite distinctly distinctly upon upon my my ear
down could could only only have have come come from from the the old old man man at at my my
side and and yet yet he he sat sat now now as as absorbed absorbed as as ever very very thin very very
wrinkled bent bent with with age an an opium opium pipe pipe down down from from between between
his his knees as as though though it it had had dropped dropped in in sheer sheer lassitude lassitude from from his his
fingers two two steps steps forward forward and and back all all my my
self-control selfcontrol to to prevent prevent me me from from breaking breaking out out into into a a cry cry of of
astonishment had had turned turned his his back back so so that that none none could could see see him him
but but form form had had filled filled out his his were were gone the the dull dull
eyes eyes had had their their fire and and there sitting sitting by by the the fire fire and and
at at my my surprise was was none none other other than than
made made a a slight slight motion motion to to me me to to approach approach him and and as as he he
turned turned his his face face half half round round to to the the company company once once more
into into a a doddering senility

such such a a quiet quiet air air of of mastery felt however that that when when
was was once once confined confined in in the the cab cab my my mission mission was was practically practically
accomplished and and for for the the rest could could not not wish wish anything anything better better
than than to to be be associated associated with with my my friend friend in in one one of of those those singular singular

inquiry and and have have to to find find a a clue clue in in the the incoherent incoherent
of of these these as as have have done done before before now been been
in in that that den den my my life life would would not not have have been been worth worth an an
hours purchase for for have have used used it it before before now now for for my my own own
purposes and and the the rascally rascally who who runs runs it it has has sworn sworn to to have have
vengeance vengeance upon upon me is is a a trapdoor at at the the back back of of that that
building near near the the corner corner of of which which could could tell tell some some
strange strange tales tales of of what what has has passed passed through through it it upon upon the the moonless moonless
nights

do do not not mean mean bodies

bodies should should be be rich rich men men if if we we had had pounds pounds

trap trap should should be be here put put his his two two between between his his
teeth teeth and and signal signal which which was was by by a a
similar similar whistle whistle from from the the distance shortly shortly by by the the rattle rattle
of of wheels wheels and and the the clink clink of of horses

the the horse horse with with his his whip and and we we dashed dashed away away through through
the the endless endless succession succession of of and and deserted deserted streets which which
gradually until until we we were were flying flying across across a a broad broad
bridge with with the the murky murky river river flowing flowing sluggishly sluggishly
beneath beneath us lay lay another another dull dull wilderness wilderness of of bricks bricks and and
mortar its its silence silence broken broken only only by by the the heavy regular regular footfall footfall of of
the the policeman or or the the and and of of some some belated belated party party of of
dull dull wrack wrack was was drifting drifting slowly slowly across across the the sky and and a a
star star or or two two dimly dimly here here and and there there through through the the of of
the the clouds drove drove in in silence with with his his head head sunk sunk upon upon his his
breast and and the the air air of of a a man man who who is is lost lost in in thought while while sat sat
beside beside him curious curious to to learn learn what what this this new new quest quest might might be be which which
to to tax tax his his powers powers so so sorely and and yet yet afraid afraid to to break break in in
upon upon the the current current of of his his thoughts had had driven driven several several
and and were were beginning beginning to to get get to to the the fringe fringe of of the the belt belt of of suburban suburban

have have a a grand grand gift gift of of silence said said he makes makes
you you quite quite invaluable invaluable as as a a companion my my word it it is is a a great great
thing thing for for me me to to have have to to talk talk to for for my my own own thoughts thoughts are are
not not was was what what should should say say to to this this dear dear
little little woman woman tonight when when she she meets meets me me at at the the door

forget forget that that know know nothing nothing about about it

shall shall just just have have time time to to tell tell you you the the facts facts of of the the case case before before
we we get get to to seems seems absurdly absurdly simple and and yet somehow somehow can can
get get nothing nothing to to go go upon plenty plenty of of thread no no doubt but but
can't cant get get the the end end of of it it into into my my hand state state the the case case
clearly clearly and and concisely concisely to to you and and maybe maybe you you can can see see a a
spark spark where where all all is is dark dark to to me

then

years years be be definite in in came came to to
a a gentleman by by name who who to to have have
plenty plenty of of money a a large large villa laid laid out out the the grounds grounds very very
nicely and and lived lived generally generally in in good good style degrees degrees he he made made
friends friends in in the the and and in in he he married married the the daughter daughter
of of a a local local brewer by by whom whom he he now now has has two two children had had no no
occupation but but was was interested interested in in several several and and into into
town town as as a a rule rule in in the the morning returning returning by by the the from from
every every night is is now now years years of of
age is is a a man man of of temperate temperate habits a a good good husband a a very very
affectionate affectionate father and and a a man man who who is is popular popular with with all all who who know know
him may may add add that that his his whole whole debts debts at at the the present present moment as as far far
as as we we have have been been able able to to ascertain amount amount to to pounds pounds while while
he he has has pounds pounds standing standing to to his his credit credit in in the the and and
is is no no reason therefore to to think think that that money money
troubles troubles have have been been weighing weighing upon upon his his mind

into into town town rather rather earlier earlier
than than usual before before he he that that he he had had two two important important
to to perform and and that that he he would would bring bring his his little little boy boy
home home a a box box of of bricks by by the the chance his his wife wife
received received a a telegram telegram upon upon this this same same very very shortly shortly after after his his
departure to to the the effect effect that that a a small small parcel parcel of of considerable considerable
value value which which she she had had been been expecting expecting was was waiting waiting for for her her at at the the
offices offices of of the the if if you you are are well well up up
in in your your you you will will know know that that the the office office of of the the company company is is
in in which which out out of of where where
you you found found me me tonight had had her her lunch for for
the the did did some some shopping to to the the office
her her packet and and found found herself herself at at exactly exactly walking walking through through
on on her her way way back back to to the the station you you me me
so so far

is is very very clear

you you remember was was an an exceedingly exceedingly hot hot day and and
walked walked slowly about about in in the the hope hope of of seeing seeing a a cab
as as she she did did not not like like the the in in which which she she found found herself
she she was was walking walking in in this this way way down down she she suddenly suddenly
heard heard an an ejaculation ejaculation or or cry and and was was struck struck cold cold to to see see her her
husband husband looking looking down down at at her her and as as it it to to her
to to her her from from a a window window window was was open and and she she
distinctly distinctly saw saw his his face which which she she as as being being terribly terribly
agitated his his hands hands frantically frantically to to her and and then then
vanished vanished from from the the window window so so suddenly suddenly that that it it to to her her that that
he he had had been been plucked plucked back back by by some some irresistible irresistible force force from from behind
singular singular point point which which struck struck her her quick quick feminine feminine eye eye was was that that
although although he he some some dark dark coat such such as as he he had had to to town town
in he he had had on on neither neither collar collar nor nor necktie

that that something something was was amiss amiss with with him she she down down the the
the the house house was was none none other other than than the the opium opium den den in in which which
you you found found me me running running through through the the front front room room she she
attempted attempted to to ascend ascend the the stairs stairs which which led led to to the the first first floor
the the foot foot of of the the stairs however she she met met this this scoundrel scoundrel of of
whom whom have have spoken who who thrust thrust her her back back and by by a a who who
acts acts as as assistant assistant there pushed pushed her her out out into into the the street
with with the the most most doubts doubts and and fears she she down down the the
lane lane and by by rare rare met met in in a a number number of of
with with an an inspector all all on on their their way way to to their their beat
inspector inspector and and two two men men accompanied accompanied her her back and and in in spite spite of of the the
continued continued resistance resistance of of the the proprietor they they made made their their way way to to
the the room room in in which which had had last last been been seen was was no no
sign sign of of him him there fact in in the the whole whole of of that that floor floor there there was was
no no one one to to be be found found save save a a crippled crippled wretch wretch of of hideous hideous aspect who
it it seems made made his his home home there he he and and the the stoutly stoutly
that that no no one one else else had had been been in in the the front front room room during during the the
afternoon determined determined was was their their denial denial that that the the inspector inspector was was
and and had had almost almost come come to to believe believe that that had had
been been when with with a a cry she she at at a a small small deal deal box box
which which lay lay upon upon the the table table and and the the lid lid from from it there there fell fell
a a cascade cascade of of bricks was was the the toy toy which which he he had had
promised promised to to bring bring home

discovery and and the the evident evident confusion confusion which which the the cripple cripple
made made the the inspector inspector that that the the matter matter was was serious
rooms rooms were were carefully carefully and and results results all all pointed pointed to to an an
abominable abominable crime front front room room was was plainly plainly furnished furnished as as a a
and and led led into into a a small small bedroom which which out out upon upon
the the back back of of one one of of the the the the wharf wharf and and the the bedroom bedroom
window window is is a a narrow narrow strip which which is is dry dry at at low low tide tide but but is is covered covered
at at high high tide tide with with at at least least four four and and a a half half feet feet of of water
bedroom bedroom window window was was a a broad broad one one and and opened opened from from below
examination examination traces traces of of blood blood were were to to be be seen seen upon upon the the windowsill
and and several several scattered scattered drops drops were were visible visible upon upon the the wooden wooden floor floor of of
the the bedroom away away behind behind a a curtain curtain in in the the front front room room were were
all all the the clothes clothes of of with with the the exception exception of of
his his coat boots his his his his hat and and his his were were
there were were no no signs signs of of violence violence upon upon any any of of these these
and and there there were were no no other other traces traces of of
of of the the window window he he must must apparently apparently have have gone gone for for no no
other other exit exit could could be be discovered and and the the ominous ominous upon upon
the the sill sill little little promise promise that that he he could could save save himself himself by by
swimming for for the the tide tide was was at at its its very very highest highest at at the the moment moment of of
the the tragedy

now now as as to to the the who who to to be be immediately immediately
implicated implicated in in the the matter was was known known to to be be a a man man of of the the
but but as by by story he he was was
known known to to have have been been at at the the foot foot of of the the stair stair within within a a very very few few
of of her her appearance appearance at at the the window he he could could
hardly hardly have have been been more more than than an an accessory accessory to to the the crime
was was one one of of absolute absolute ignorance and and he he protested protested that that he he had had no no
knowledge knowledge as as to to the the doings doings of of his his lodger and and that that he he
could could not not account account in in any any way way for for the the presence presence of of the the missing missing
clothes

much much for for the the manager for for the the sinister sinister cripple cripple who who
lives lives upon upon the the second second floor floor of of the the opium opium den and and who who was was
certainly certainly the the last last human human being being whose whose eyes eyes rested rested upon upon
name name is is and and his his hideous hideous face face is is one one which which
is is familiar familiar to to every every man man who who goes goes much much to to the the is is a a
professional professional beggar though though in in order order to to avoid avoid the the police police
he he to to a a small small trade trade in in wax wax
little little distance distance down down upon upon the the
side there there is as as you you may may have have a a small small angle angle in in the the
wall it it is is that that this this creature creature takes takes his his daily daily seat
cross-legged with with his his tiny tiny stock stock of of on on his his lap and and as as he he
is is a a piteous piteous spectacle spectacle a a small small rain rain of of charity charity into into the the
greasy greasy leather leather cap cap which which lies lies upon upon the the pavement pavement beside beside him
have have watched watched the the fellow fellow more more than than once once before before ever ever thought thought of of
making making his his professional professional acquaintance and and have have been been surprised surprised
at at the the harvest harvest which which he he has has in in a a short short time
appearance you you see is is so so remarkable remarkable that that no no one one can can pass pass him him
without without observing observing him shock shock of of orange orange hair a a pale pale face face
disfigured disfigured by by a a horrible horrible scar which by by its its contraction has has
turned turned up up the the outer outer edge edge of of his his upper upper lip a a bulldog bulldog chin and and a a
pair pair of of very very penetrating penetrating dark dark eyes which which present present a a singular singular
contrast contrast to to the the of of his his hair all all mark mark him him out out from from amid amid
the the common common crowd crowd of of and and so too does does his his wit for for he he
is is ever ever ready ready with with a a reply reply to to any any piece piece of of chaff chaff which which may may be be
thrown thrown at at him him by by the the is is the the man man whom whom we we now now
learn learn to to have have been been the the lodger lodger at at the the opium opium den and and to to have have been been
the the last last man man to to see see the the gentleman gentleman of of whom whom we we are are in in quest

a a cripple said said could could he he have have done done single-handed singlehanded
against against a a man man in in the the prime prime of of life

continue continue your your narrative

had had at at the the sight sight of of the the blood blood upon upon the the
window and and she she was was home home in in a a cab cab by by the the police as as her her
presence presence could could be be of of no no help help to to them them in in their their
who who had had charge charge of of the the case made made a a very very careful careful
examination examination of of the the premises but but without without finding finding anything anything which which
any any light light upon upon the the matter mistake mistake had had been been made made in in not not
arresting arresting as as he he was was allowed allowed some some few few minutes minutes
during during which which he he might might have have communicated communicated with with his his friend friend the the
but but this this fault fault was was soon soon and and he he was was seized seized and and
without without anything anything being being found found which which could could incriminate incriminate
him were it it is is true some some upon upon his his right right
shirtsleeve but but he he pointed pointed to to his his which which had had been been
cut cut near near the the nail and and that that the the bleeding bleeding came came from from
there adding adding that that he he had had been been to to the the window window not not long long before and and
that that the the which which had had been been observed observed there there came came doubtless doubtless from from
the the same same source denied denied strenuously strenuously having having ever ever seen seen
and and that that the the presence presence of of the the clothes clothes in in
his his room room was was as as much much a a mystery mystery to to him him as as to to the the police to to
assertion assertion that that she she had had actually actually seen seen her her husband husband
at at the the window he he declared declared that that she she must must have have been been either either mad mad or or
dreaming was was removed loudly loudly to to the the
while while the the inspector inspector upon upon the the premises premises in in
the the hope hope that that the the ebbing ebbing tide tide might might afford afford some some fresh fresh clue

it it did though though they they hardly hardly found found upon upon the the what what they they
had had to to find was was coat and and not not
which which lay lay uncovered uncovered as as the the tide tide
what what do do you you think think they they found found in in the the pockets

cannot cannot imagine

don't dont think think you you would would guess pocket pocket stuffed stuffed with with
and and and and
was was no no wonder wonder that that it it had had not not been been swept swept away away by by the the tide a a
human human body body is is a a different different matter is is a a fierce fierce eddy eddy between between
the the wharf wharf and and the the house likely likely enough enough that that the the
weighted weighted coat coat had had when when the the stripped stripped body body had had been been
away away into into the the river

understand understand that that all all the the other other clothes clothes were were found found in in the the
room the the body body be be dressed dressed in in a a coat coat alone

sir but but the the facts facts might might be be met met speciously speciously enough
that that this this man man had had thrust thrust through through the the
window there there is is no no human human eye eye which which could could have have seen seen the the deed
would would he he do do then would would of of course course strike strike him him
that that he he must must get get rid rid of of the the telltale would would seize seize
the the coat then and and be be in in the the act act of of it it out when when it it
would would occur occur to to him him that that it it would would swim swim and and not not sink has has little little
time for for he he has has heard heard the the scuffle scuffle downstairs downstairs when when the the wife wife tried tried
to to force force her her way way up and and perhaps perhaps he he has has already already heard heard from from his his
confederate confederate that that the the police police are are hurrying hurrying up up the the street
is is not not an an instant instant to to be be lost to to some some secret secret
hoard where where he he has has accumulated accumulated the the fruits fruits of of his his beggary and and he he
stuffs stuffs all all the the coins coins upon upon which which he he can can lay lay his his hands hands into into the the
pockets pockets to to make make sure sure of of the the coats sinking it it out and and
would would have have done done the the same same with with the the other other had had not not he he heard heard
the the rush rush of of steps steps below and and only only just just had had time time to to close close the the
window window when when the the police police

certainly certainly sounds sounds feasible

we we will will take take it it as as a a working working hypothesis hypothesis for for want want of of a a
better as as have have told told you was was arrested arrested and and taken taken to to the the
station but but it it could could not not be be shown shown that that there there had had ever ever before before
been been anything anything against against him had had for for years years been been known known as as a a
professional professional beggar but but his his life life to to have have been been a a very very
quiet quiet and and innocent innocent one the the matter matter stands stands at at present and and
the the questions questions which which have have to to be be was was
doing doing in in the the opium opium den what what to to him him when when there where where is is
he he now and and what what had had to to do do with with his his
all all as as far far from from a a solution solution as as ever confess confess that that cannot cannot

keenly keenly down down at at him him as as he he leaned leaned back back in in a a

then madam do do not

think think that that he he is is dead

do



don't dont say say that

perhaps you you will will be be good good enough enough to to explain explain how how
it it is is that that have have received received a a letter letter from from him him today

out out of of his his chair chair as as if if he he had had been been


he he

today stood stood smiling holding holding up up a a little little slip slip of of
paper paper in in the the air

see see it



it it from from her her in in his his eagerness and and it it out out
upon upon the the table table he he over over the the lamp lamp and and it it intently
had had left left my my chair chair and and was was gazing gazing at at it it over over his his shoulder
envelope envelope was was a a very very coarse coarse one one and and was was stamped stamped with with the the
postmark postmark and and with with the the date date of of that that very very day or or rather rather of of the the day day
before for for it it was was after after midnight

writing this this is is not not your your
writing madam

but but the the enclosure enclosure is

perceive perceive also also that that addressed addressed the the envelope envelope had had to to go go
and and inquire inquire as as to to the the address

can can you you tell tell that

name you you see is is in in perfectly perfectly black black ink which which has has dried dried
itself rest rest is is of of the the which which that that
has has been been used it it had had been been written written straight straight
off and and then then none none would would be be of of a a deep deep black black shade
man man has has written written the the name and and there there has has then then been been a a pause pause before before
he he wrote wrote the the address which which can can only only mean mean that that he he was was not not
familiar familiar with with it is of of course a a trifle but but there there is is
nothing nothing so so important important as as trifles us us now now see see the the letter
there there has has been been an an enclosure enclosure here

there there was was a a ring

you you are are sure sure that that this this is is your your hand

of of his his hands



hand hand when when he he wrote wrote hurriedly is is very very unlike unlike his his usual usual
writing and and yet yet know know it it well

do do not not be be frightened will will come come well is is a a
huge huge error error which which it it may may take take some some little little time time to to rectify
in in in in pencil pencil upon upon the the flyleaf
of of a a book octavo octavo size no no watermark today in in
by by a a man man with with a a dirty dirty thumb the the flap flap has has been been
gummed if if am am not not very very much much in in error by by a a person person who who had had been been
chewing chewing tobacco you you have have no no doubt doubt that that it it is is your your
hand madam

wrote wrote those those words

they they were were today at at
the the clouds clouds lighten though though should should not not venture venture to to say say that that the the
danger danger is is over

he he must must be be alive

this this is is a a clever clever forgery forgery to to put put us us on on the the wrong wrong scent
ring after after all nothing may may have have been been taken taken from from
him

no it it is it it is is his his very very own own writing

well may however have have been been written written on on and and only only
today

is is possible

so much much may may have have between

you you must must not not discourage discourage me know know that that all all is is
well well with with him is is so so keen keen a a sympathy sympathy between between us us that that
should should know know if if evil evil came came upon upon him the the very very day day that that saw saw him him
last last he he cut cut himself himself in in the the bedroom and and yet yet in in the the
upstairs upstairs with with the the utmost utmost certainty certainty that that
something something had had you you think think that that would would respond respond to to such such
a a trifle trifle and and yet yet be be ignorant ignorant of of his his death

have have seen seen too too much much not not to to know know that that the the impression impression of of a a woman woman
may may be be more more valuable valuable than than the the conclusion conclusion of of an an analytical analytical
reasoner in in this this letter letter you you certainly certainly have have a a very very strong strong
piece piece of of evidence evidence to to corroborate corroborate your your view if if your your husband husband
is is alive alive and and able able to to write write letters why why should should he he remain remain away away
from from you

cannot cannot imagine is is unthinkable

on on he he made made no no before before leaving leaving you



you you were were surprised surprised to to see see him him in in

much much so

his his hands

it it might might have have been been a a cry cry of of surprise at at the the
unexpected unexpected sight sight of of you you might might cause cause him him to to throw throw up up his his hands

is is possible

room

schoolmaster schoolmaster in in where where received received an an excellent excellent
education in in my my youth to to the the stage and and
finally finally became became a a reporter reporter on on an an evening evening paper paper in in day day
my my editor editor wished wished to to have have a a series series of of articles articles upon upon begging begging in in the the
metropolis and and to to supply supply them was was the the point point
from from which which all all my my adventures adventures was was only only by by trying trying
begging begging as as an an amateur amateur that that could could get get the the facts facts upon upon which which to to
base base my my articles an an actor actor had of of course learned learned all all the the
secrets secrets of of making making up and and had had been been famous famous in in the the greenroom for for
my my skill advantage advantage now now of of my my attainments painted painted my my
face and and to to make make myself myself as as pitiable pitiable as as possible possible made made a a good good
scar scar and and fixed fixed one one side side of of my my lip lip in in a a twist twist by by the the aid aid of of a a
small small slip slip of of plaster with with a a red red head head of of
hair and and an an appropriate appropriate dress my my station station in in the the business business
part part of of the the city ostensibly ostensibly as as a a but but really really as as a a
beggar seven seven hours hours my my trade and and when when
home home in in the the evening evening found found to to my my surprise surprise that that had had received received no no
less less than than

wrote wrote my my articles articles and and thought thought little little more more of of the the matter matter until
some some time time later backed backed a a bill bill for for a a friend friend and and had had a a writ writ
served served upon upon me me for for pounds was was at at my my wits end end where where to to get get
the the money but but a a sudden sudden idea idea came came to to me a a
grace grace from from the the creditor asked asked for for a a holiday holiday from from my my
and and spent spent the the time time in in begging begging in in the the under under my my disguise
ten ten days days had had the the money money and and had had paid paid the the debt

you you can can imagine imagine how how hard hard it it was was to to settle settle down down to to arduous arduous
work work at at pounds pounds a a week week when when that that could could earn earn as as much much in in
a a day day by by my my face face with with a a little little paint laying laying my my cap cap on on
the the ground and and sitting sitting still was was a a long long fight fight between between my my
pride pride and and the the money but but the the won won at at last and and up up
and and sat sat day day after after day day in in the the corner corner which which had had first first
chosen inspiring inspiring pity pity by by my my ghastly ghastly face face and and filling filling my my pockets pockets
with with one one man man my my secret was was the the keeper keeper of of a a
low low den den in in which which used used to to lodge lodge in in where where could could
every every morning morning emerge emerge as as a a squalid squalid beggar beggar and and in in the the
transform transform myself myself into into a a man man about about town fellow
a a was was well well paid paid by by me me for for his his rooms so so that that that that
my my secret secret was was safe safe in in his his possession

very very soon soon found found that that was was saving saving considerable considerable of of
money do do not not mean mean that that any any beggar beggar in in the the streets streets of of
could could earn earn pounds pounds a a is is less less than than my my average average
had had exceptional exceptional in in my my power power of of making making
up and and also also in in a a facility facility of of repartee which which improved improved by by
practice practice and and made made me me quite quite a a character character in in the the
day day a a stream stream of of varied varied by by silver in in upon upon me
and and it it was was a a very very bad bad day day in in which which failed failed to to take take pounds

more more ambitious a a house house in in the the
country and and eventually eventually married without without having having a a
suspicion suspicion as as to to my my real real occupation dear dear wife wife that that had had
business business in in the the little little what

had had finished finished for for the the day day and and was was dressing dressing in in my my
room room above above the the opium opium den den when when out out of of my my window window and and saw
to to my my horror horror and and astonishment that that my my wife wife was was standing standing in in the the
street with with her her eyes eyes fixed fixed full full upon upon me a a cry cry of of
surprise up up my my arms arms to to cover cover my my face and rushing rushing to to my my
confidant the the him him to to prevent prevent from from
coming coming up up to to me heard heard her her voice voice downstairs but but that that
she she could could not not ascend off off my my clothes pulled pulled on on
those those of of a a beggar and and put put on on my my pigments pigments and and wig a a
eyes eyes could could not not pierce pierce so so complete complete a a disguise then then it it
occurred occurred to to me me that that there there might might be be a a search search in in the the room and and that that
the the clothes clothes might might betray betray me open open the the window
by by my my violence violence a a small small cut cut which which had had upon upon myself myself in in
the the bedroom bedroom that that morning seized seized my my coat which which was was
weighted weighted by by the the which which had had just just transferred transferred to to it it from from
the the leather leather bag bag in in which which carried carried my my it it out out of of
the the window and and it it into into the the other other clothes clothes
would would have have but but at at that that moment moment there there was was a a rush rush of of
up up the the stair and and a a few few minutes minutes after after found rather
confess to to my my relief that that instead instead of of being being identified identified as as
was was arrested arrested as as his his murderer

do do not not know know that that there there is is anything anything else else for for me me to to explain
was was determined determined to to preserve preserve my my disguise disguise as as long long as as possible and and
hence hence my my preference preference for for a a dirty dirty face that that my my wife wife would would
be be terribly terribly anxious off off my my ring ring and and it it to to the the
at at a a moment moment when when no no constable constable was was me together together
with with a a hurried hurried scrawl telling telling her her that that she she had had no no cause cause to to
fear

note note only only her her yesterday said said

allude allude to to my my attempt attempt to to recover recover the the
papers to to the the singular singular case case of of and and to to the the
adventure adventure of of the the man man with with the the twisted twisted lip have have no no doubt doubt
that that this this small small matter matter will will fall fall into into the the same same innocent innocent category
know know the the commissionaire



is is to to him him that that this this trophy trophy

is is his his hat

no he he found found it owner owner is is unknown beg beg that that you you will will
look look upon upon it it not not as as a a battered battered billycock billycock but but as as an an intellectual intellectual
problem first as as to to how how it it came came here upon upon
morning in in company company with with a a good good fat fat goose which which is
have have no no doubt roasting roasting at at this this moment moment in in front front of of
fire facts facts are are these about about four four o'clock oclock on on
morning who as as you you know is is a a very very honest honest fellow was was
returning returning from from some some small small jollification jollification and and was was making making his his way way
homeward homeward down down front front of of him him he he saw in in
the the gaslight a a tallish tallish man walking walking with with a a slight slight stagger and and
carrying carrying a a white white goose goose slung slung over over his his shoulder he he the the
corner corner of of a a row row broke broke out out between between this this stranger stranger
and and a a little little knot knot of of of of the the latter latter knocked knocked off off the the
mans hat on on which which he he raised raised his his stick stick to to defend defend himself himself and
swinging swinging it it over over his his head the the shop shop window window behind behind him
had had forward forward to to protect protect the the stranger stranger from from his his
but but the the man at at having having broken broken the the window and and
seeing seeing an an person person in in uniform uniform rushing rushing towards towards him
dropped dropped his his goose to to his his heels and and vanished vanished amid amid the the
labyrinth labyrinth of of small small streets streets which which lie lie at at the the back back of of
had had also also fled fled at at the the appearance appearance of of
so so that that he he was was left left in in possession possession of of the the field field of of
battle and and also also of of the the spoils spoils of of victory victory in in the the shape shape of of this this
battered battered hat hat and and a a most most unimpeachable unimpeachable goose

surely surely he he restored restored to to their their owner

dear dear fellow there there lies lies the the problem is is true true that that
was was printed printed upon upon a a small small card card which which was was tied tied to to
the the birds left left leg and and it it is is also also true true that that the the
are are legible legible upon upon the the lining lining of of this this hat but but as as there there are are
some some of of and and some some hundreds hundreds of of in in
this this city city of of ours it it is is not not easy easy to to restore restore lost lost property property to to any any
one one of of them

then did did do

brought brought round round both both hat hat and and goose goose to to me me on on morning
knowing knowing that that even even the the smallest smallest are are of of interest interest to to me
goose goose we we retained retained until until this this morning when when there there were were signs signs
that in in spite spite of of the the slight slight frost it it would would be be well well that that it it
should should be be eaten eaten without without unnecessary unnecessary delay finder finder has has carried carried
it it off therefore to to the the ultimate ultimate destiny destiny of of a a goose
while while continue continue to to retain retain the the hat hat of of the the unknown unknown gentleman gentleman who who
lost lost his his dinner

he he not not advertise



what what clue clue could could you you have have as as to to his his identity

as as much much as as we we can can deduce

his his hat



you you are are joking can can you you gather gather from from this this old old battered battered
felt

is is my my lens know know my my can can you you gather gather
yourself yourself as as to to the the individuality individuality of of the the man man who who has has worn worn this this
article

the the tattered tattered object object in in my my hands hands and and turned turned it it over over rather rather
ruefully was was a a very very ordinary ordinary black black hat hat of of the the usual usual round round
shape hard hard and and much much the the worse worse for for wear lining lining had had been been of of
red red silk but but was was a a good good deal deal was was no no
name but as as had had the the were were
scrawled scrawled upon upon one one side was was pierced pierced in in the the brim brim for for a a
but but the the elastic elastic was was missing the the rest it it was was
cracked exceedingly exceedingly dusty and and spotted spotted in in several several places
although although there there to to have have been been some some attempt attempt to to hide hide the the
by by them them with with ink

can can see see nothing said said it it back back to to my my friend

the the contrary you you can can see see everything fail
however to to reason reason from from what what you you see are are too too timid timid in in
drawing drawing your your

pray pray tell tell me me what what it it is is that that you you can can infer infer from from this this hat

picked picked it it up up and and at at it it in in the the peculiar peculiar introspective introspective
fashion fashion which which was was characteristic characteristic of of him is is perhaps perhaps less less
suggestive suggestive than than it it might might have have been he he and yet yet there there
are are a a few few which which are are very very distinct and and a a few few others others
which which represent represent at at least least a a strong strong balance balance of of probability
the the man man was was highly highly intellectual intellectual is is of of course course obvious obvious upon upon the the
face face of of it and and also also that that he he was was fairly fairly within within the the
last last three three years although although he he has has now now fallen fallen upon upon evil evil days
had had foresight but but has has less less now now than than formerly pointing pointing to to a a
moral moral retrogression which when when taken taken with with the the decline decline of of his his
fortunes seems seems to to indicate indicate some some evil evil influence probably probably drink
at at work work upon upon him may may account account also also for for the the obvious obvious fact fact that that
his his wife wife has has to to love love him

dear dear

has however retained retained some some degree degree of of selfrespect he he
continued disregarding disregarding my my remonstrance is is a a man man who who leads leads a a
sedentary sedentary life goes goes out out little is is out out of of training training entirely is is
middleaged has has grizzled grizzled hair hair which which he he has has had had cut cut within within the the
last last few few days and and which which he he with with are are
the the more more patent patent facts facts which which are are to to be be from from his his hat
by by the the way that that it it is is extremely extremely improbable improbable that that he he has has gas gas laid laid
on on in in his his house

are are certainly certainly joking

in in the the least it it possible possible that that even even now when when give give you you
these these results you you are are unable unable to to see see how how they they are are attained

have have no no doubt doubt that that am am very very stupid but but must must confess confess that that
am am unable unable to to follow follow you example how how did did you you deduce deduce that that
this this man man was was intellectual

answer answer the the hat hat upon upon his his head came came right right
over over the the forehead forehead and and settled settled upon upon the the bridge bridge of of his his nose is is
a a question question of of cubic cubic capacity said said he a man man with with so so large large a a
brain brain must must have have something something in in it

decline decline of of his his fortunes then

hat hat is is three three years years old flat flat curled curled at at the the edge edge
came came in in then is is a a hat hat of of the the very very best best quality at at the the
band band of of ribbed ribbed silk silk and and the the excellent excellent lining this this man man could could
afford afford to to buy buy so so expensive expensive a a hat hat three three years years ago and and has has had had no no
hat hat since then then he he has has assuredly assuredly gone gone down down in in the the world

that that is is clear clear enough certainly how how about about the the
foresight foresight and and the the moral moral retrogression

is is the the foresight said said he he putting putting
his his finger finger upon upon the the little little disc disc and and loop loop of of the the
are are never never sold sold upon upon this this man man ordered ordered one it it is is a a
sign sign of of a a certain certain amount amount of of foresight since since he he out out of of his his
way way to to take take this this precaution precaution against against the the wind since since we we see see
that that he he has has broken broken the the elastic elastic and and has has not not troubled troubled to to replace replace
it it it is is obvious obvious that that he he has has less less foresight foresight now now than than formerly
which which is is a a distinct distinct proof proof of of a a weakening weakening nature the the other other
hand he he has has to to conceal conceal some some of of these these upon upon the the
felt felt by by daubing daubing them them with with ink which which is is a a sign sign that that he he has has not not
entirely entirely lost lost his his selfrespect

reasoning reasoning is is certainly certainly plausible

further further points that that he he is is middleaged that that his his hair hair is is
grizzled that that it it has has been been recently recently cut and and that that he he
are are all all to to be be gathered gathered from from a a close close examination examination of of the the
lower lower part part of of the the lining lens lens a a large large number number of of
clean clean cut cut by by the the scissors scissors of of the the barber all all
appear appear to to be be adhesive and and there there is is a a distinct distinct of of
dust you you will will observe is is not not the the gritty grey grey
dust dust of of the the street street but but the the fluffy fluffy brown brown dust dust of of the the house
showing showing that that it it has has been been hung hung up up most most of of the the time while while
the the marks marks of of moisture moisture upon upon the the inside inside are are proof proof positive positive that that the the
wearer wearer very very freely and and could could therefore hardly hardly be be in in
the the best best of of training

his his said said that that she she had had to to love love him

hat hat has has not not been been brushed brushed for for see see you my my dear dear
with with a a accumulation accumulation of of dust dust upon upon your your hat and and
when when your your wife wife you you to to go go out out in in such such a a state shall shall fear fear
that that you you also also have have been been unfortunate unfortunate enough enough to to lose lose your your
affection

he he might might be be a a bachelor

he he was was bringing bringing home home the the goose goose as as a a to to his his
wife the the card card upon upon the the birds leg

have have an an answer answer to to everything how how on on earth earth do do you you deduce deduce
that that the the gas gas is is not not laid laid on on in in his his house

tallow tallow stain or or even even two might might come come by by chance but but when when
see see no no less less than than five think think that that there there can can be be little little doubt doubt
that that the the individual individual must must be be brought brought into into frequent frequent contact contact with with
burning burning upstairs upstairs at at night night probably probably with with his his hat hat in in
one one hand hand and and a a guttering guttering candle candle in in the the other he he never never
from from a a you you satisfied

it it is is very very ingenious said said laughing but since as as
you you said said just just now there there has has been been no no crime crime committed and and no no harm harm
done done save save the the loss loss of of a a goose all all this this seems seems to to be be rather rather a a
waste waste of of energy

had had opened opened his his mouth mouth to to reply when when the the door door
open and and the the commissionaire into into the the apartment apartment
with with flushed flushed cheeks cheeks and and the the face face of of a a man man who who is is dazed dazed with with
astonishment

goose goose sir he he

of of it then it it to to life life and and off off
through through the the kitchen kitchen window twisted twisted himself himself round round upon upon
the the sofa sofa to to get get a a view view of of the the mans excited excited face

here sir what what my my wife wife found found in in its its crop held held out out
his his hand hand and and upon upon the the centre centre of of the the palm palm a a brilliantly brilliantly
scintillating scintillating blue blue stone rather rather smaller smaller than than a a bean bean in in size but but
of of such such purity purity and and radiance radiance that that it it like like an an electric electric
point point in in the the dark dark hollow hollow of of his his hand

sat sat up up with with a a whistle said said
he this is is treasure treasure trove trove indeed suppose suppose you you know know what what you you
have have

diamond sir precious precious stone into into glass glass as as though though
it it were were putty

more more than than a a precious precious stone is is the the precious precious stone

the the of of blue blue carbuncle

so ought ought to to know know its its size size and and shape seeing seeing that that
have have read read the the advertisement advertisement about about it it in in every every day day
lately is is absolutely absolutely unique and and its its value value can can only only be be
but but the the reward reward offered offered of of pounds pounds is is certainly certainly
not not within within a a twentieth twentieth part part of of the the market market price

thousand thousand pounds of of mercy commissionaire commissionaire
down down into into a a chair chair and and from from one one to to the the other other of of us

is is the the reward and and have have reason reason to to know know that that there there are are
sentimental sentimental in in the the background background which which would would induce induce
the the to to part part with with half half her her fortune fortune if if she she could could but but
recover recover the the gem

was was lost if if remember remember aright at at the the


so on on just just five five days days ago
a a plumber was was accused accused of of having having abstracted abstracted it it from from the the ladys
evidence evidence against against him him was was so so strong strong that that the the case case
has has been been to to the the have have some some account account of of the the
matter matter here believe amid amid his his newspapers
over over the the until until at at last last he he smoothed smoothed one one out
doubled doubled it it over and and read read the the following following paragraph

plumber was was
brought brought up up upon upon the the charge charge of of having having upon upon the the
abstracted abstracted from from the the of of the the of of the the

solder solder the the second second bar bar of of the the grate which which was was loose had had
with with some some little little time but but had had finally finally been been
called called away returning he he found found that that had had
that that the the bureau bureau had had been been forced forced open and and that that the the small small morocco morocco
casket casket in in which as as it it afterwards afterwards the the was was
accustomed accustomed to to keep keep her her jewel was was lying lying empty empty upon upon the the
the the alarm and and was was
arrested arrested the the same same evening but but the the stone stone could could not not be be found found
either either upon upon his his person person or or in in his his rooms maid maid to to

during during the the proceedings away away at at the the conclusion conclusion and and was was
carried carried out out of of court

much much for for the the said said thoughtfully
tossing tossing aside aside the the paper question question for for us us now now to to solve solve is is the the
sequence sequence of of events events leading leading from from a a rifled rifled at at one one end end to to
the the crop crop of of a a goose goose in in at at the the other
see our our little little have have suddenly suddenly assumed assumed a a much much
more more important important and and less less innocent innocent aspect is is the the stone the the
stone stone came came from from the the goose and and the the goose goose came came from from
the the gentleman gentleman with with the the bad bad hat hat and and all all the the other other
with with which which have have bored bored you now now we we must must set set
ourselves ourselves very very seriously seriously to to finding finding this this gentleman gentleman and and
what what part part he he has has played played in in this this little little mystery
do do this we we must must try try the the means means first and and these these lie lie
undoubtedly undoubtedly in in an an advertisement advertisement in in all all the the evening evening papers
this this fail shall shall have have recourse recourse to to other other

will will you you say

me me a a pencil pencil and and that that slip slip of of paper then at at
the the corner corner of of a a goose goose and and a a black black felt felt hat
can can have have the the same same by by at at this this evening evening at at
is is clear clear and and concise

will will he he see see it

he he is is sure sure to to keep keep an an eye eye on on the the papers since to to a a poor poor
man the the loss loss was was a a heavy heavy one was was clearly clearly so so by by his his
mischance mischance in in breaking breaking the the window window and and by by the the approach approach of of
that that he he thought thought of of nothing nothing but but flight but but since since then then he he must must
have have bitterly bitterly regretted regretted the the impulse impulse which which caused caused him him to to drop drop his his
bird again the the introduction introduction of of his his name name will will cause cause him him to to
see see it for for everyone everyone who who knows knows him him will will direct direct his his attention attention to to
it you you are run run down down to to the the advertising advertising agency agency
and and have have this this put put in in the the evening evening papers

which sir

in in the the
and and any any others others that that occur occur to to you

well sir this this stone

yes shall shall keep keep the the stone you say
just just buy buy a a goose goose on on your your way way back back and and leave leave it it here here
with with me for for we we must must have have one one to to give give to to this this gentleman gentleman in in place place
of of the the one one which which your your family family is is now now devouring

the the commissionaire commissionaire had had gone up up the the stone stone and and
held held it it against against the the light a a bonny bonny thing said said he
see see how how it it and and course course it it is is a a nucleus nucleus and and
focus focus of of crime good good stone stone is are are the the devils pet pet
the the larger larger and and older older jewels jewels every every facet facet may may stand stand for for a a
bloody bloody deed stone stone is is not not yet yet twenty twenty years years old was was found found
in in the the of of the the in in southern southern and and is is remarkable remarkable
in in having having every every characteristic characteristic of of the the carbuncle save save that that it it is is
blue blue in in shade shade instead instead of of ruby ruby red spite spite of of its its youth it it has has
already already a a sinister sinister history have have been been two two a a
a a suicide and and several several brought brought about about
for for the the sake sake of of this this weight weight of of charcoal
would would think think that that so so pretty pretty a a toy toy would would be be a a purveyor purveyor to to the the
gallows gallows and and the the prison lock lock it it up up in in my my strong strong box box now now and and
drop drop a a line line to to the the to to say say that that we we have have it

you you think think that that this this man man is is innocent

cannot cannot tell

then do do you you imagine imagine that that this this other other one had had
anything anything to to do do with with the the matter

is think much much more more likely likely that that is is an an
absolutely absolutely innocent innocent man who who had had no no idea idea that that the the bird bird which which he he
was was carrying carrying was was of of more more value value than than if if it it were were made made
of of solid solid gold however shall shall determine determine by by a a very very simple simple
test test if if we we have have an an answer answer to to our our advertisement

you you can can do do nothing nothing until until then



that that case case shall shall continue continue my my professional professional round shall shall
come come back back in in the the evening evening at at the the hour hour you you have have mentioned for for
should should like like to to see see the the solution solution of of so so tangled tangled a a business

glad glad to to see see you dine dine at at seven is is a a woodcock
believe the the way in in view view of of recent recent perhaps perhaps
ought ought to to ask ask to to examine examine its its crop

had had been been delayed delayed at at a a case and and it it was was a a little little after after
six six when when found found myself myself in in once once more
the the house house saw saw a a tall tall man man in in a a bonnet bonnet with with a a
coat coat which which was was buttoned buttoned up up to to his his chin chin waiting waiting outside outside in in the the
bright bright semicircle semicircle which which was was thrown thrown from from the the fanlight as as
the the door door was was opened and and we we were were shown shown up up together together to to
room

more more adapted adapted for for summer summer than than for for winter you you have have
just just come come at at the the right right time that that your your hat

sir that that is is undoubtedly undoubtedly my my hat

broad intelligent intelligent face sloping sloping down down to to a a pointed pointed beard beard of of
grizzled grizzled brown touch touch of of red red in in nose nose and and cheeks with with a a slight slight

because we we expected expected to to see see an an advertisement advertisement from from you you giving giving your your
address am am at at a a loss loss to to know know now now why why you you did did not not advertise

visitor visitor a a rather rather shamefaced shamefaced laugh have have not not
been been so so plentiful plentiful with with me me as as they they once once were he he had had
no no doubt doubt that that the the gang gang of of who who assaulted assaulted me me had had carried carried off off
both both my my hat hat and and the the bird did did not not care care to to spend spend more more money money in in a a
hopeless hopeless attempt attempt at at them

naturally the the way about about the the bird we we were were compelled compelled to to
eat eat it

eat eat it visitor visitor half half rose rose from from his his chair chair in in his his
excitement

it it would would have have been been of of no no use use to to had had we we not not done done so
presume presume that that this this other other goose goose upon upon the the sideboard which which is is
about about the the same same weight weight and and perfectly perfectly fresh will will answer answer your your
purpose purpose equally equally well

certainly certainly with with a a sigh sigh of of
relief

course we we still still have have the the feathers legs crop and and so so on on of of
your your own own bird so so if if you you wish

who who had had at at first first been been overjoyed overjoyed to to see see a a of of
back back in in the the old old family family seat he he shut shut himself himself up up in in
his his house house and and seldom seldom came came out out save save to to indulge indulge in in ferocious ferocious
with with might might cross cross his his path of of temper temper
approaching approaching to to mania mania has has been been hereditary hereditary in in the the men men of of the the
family and and in in my my case case it it had believe been been
intensified intensified by by his his long long residence residence in in the the series series of of
disgraceful disgraceful place two two of of which which ended ended in in the the
until until at at last last he he became became the the terror terror of of the the village
and and the the folks folks would would fly fly at at his his approach for for he he is is a a man man of of
immense immense strength and and absolutely absolutely uncontrollable uncontrollable in in his his anger

week week he he the the local local blacksmith blacksmith over over a a parapet parapet into into a a
stream and and it it was was only only by by paying paying over over all all the the money money which which
could could gather gather together together that that was was able able to to avert avert another another public public
exposure had had no no friends friends at at all all save save the the wandering wandering
and and he he would would give give these these leave leave to to encamp encamp upon upon the the few few
acres acres of of land land which which represent represent the the family family estate
and and would would accept accept in in return return the the hospitality hospitality of of their their tents
wandering wandering away away with with them them sometimes sometimes for for on on end has has a a
passion passion also also for for animals which which are are sent sent over over to to him him by by a a
correspondent and and he he has has at at this this moment moment a a cheetah cheetah and and a a baboon
which which wander wander freely freely over over his his grounds grounds and and are are by by the the
almost almost as as much much as as their their master

can can imagine imagine from from what what say say that that my my poor poor sister sister and and
had had no no great great pleasure pleasure in in our our lives servant servant would would stay stay with with
us and and for for a a long long time time we we did did all all the the work work of of the the house was was
but but thirty thirty at at the the time time of of her her death and and yet yet her her hair hair had had already already
begun begun to to whiten even even as as mine mine has

sister sister is is dead then

just just two two years years ago and and it it is is of of her her death death that that wish wish
to to speak speak to to you can can understand understand that living living the the life life which which
have have described we we were were little little likely likely to to see see of of our our own own
age age and and position had however an an aunt my my mothers maiden maiden
sister who who lives lives near near and and we we
were were occasionally occasionally allowed allowed to to pay pay short short visits visits at at this this ladys
house there there at at two two years years ago and and met met there there
a a half-pay major major of of marines to to whom whom she she became became engaged
stepfather stepfather learned learned of of the the engagement engagement when when my my sister sister and and
offered offered no no objection objection to to the the marriage but but within within a a fortnight fortnight of of
the the day day which which had had been been fixed fixed for for the the wedding the the terrible terrible event event
occurred occurred which which has has deprived deprived me me of of my my only only companion

had had been been leaning leaning back back in in his his chair chair with with his his eyes eyes
closed closed and and his his head head sunk sunk in in a a cushion but but he he half half opened opened his his
now now and and across across at at his his visitor

be be precise precise as as to to details said said he

is is easy easy for for me me to to be be so for for every every event event of of that that dreadful dreadful
time time is is seared seared into into my my memory manorhouse is as as have have
already already said very very old and and only only one one wing wing is is now now inhabited
in in this this wing wing are are on on the the ground ground floor the the
being being in in the the central central block block of of the the buildings these these
the the first first is is the the second second my my sisters and and the the third third
my my own is is no no communication communication between between them but but they they all all open open
out out into into the the same same corridor make make myself myself plain

so

windows windows of of the the three three rooms rooms open open out out upon upon the the lawn
fatal fatal night night had had gone gone to to his his room room early though though we we
that that he he had had not not retired retired to to rest for for my my sister sister was was troubled troubled
by by the the smell smell of of the the strong strong which which it it was was his his custom custom
to to smoke left left her her room therefore and and came came into into mine where where
she she sat sat for for some some time about about her her approaching approaching wedding
eleven eleven o'clock oclock she she rose rose to to leave leave me but but she she at at the the door door
and and back

me said said she have you you ever ever heard heard whistle whistle
in in the the dead dead of of the the night

said said

suppose suppose that that you you could could not not possibly possibly whistle yourself in in
your your sleep

not why

during during the the last last few few nights nights have have always about about three three
in in the the morning heard heard a a low clear clear whistle am am a a light light sleeper
and and it it has has awakened awakened me cannot cannot tell tell where where it it came came
from from the the next next room perhaps perhaps from from the the lawn thought thought that that would would
just just ask ask you you whether whether you you had had heard heard it

have have not must must be be those those wretched wretched in in the the
plantation

likely yet yet if if it it were were on on the the lawn wonder wonder that that you you
did did not not hear hear it it also

but but sleep sleep more more heavily heavily than than you

it it is is of of no no great great consequence at at any any rate
back back at at me closed closed my my door and and a a few few moments moments later later heard heard her her
key key turn turn in in the the lock

said said it it your your custom custom always always to to lock lock
in in at at night



why

think think that that mentioned mentioned to to you you that that the the doctor doctor kept kept a a cheetah cheetah
and and a a baboon had had no no feeling feeling of of security security unless unless our our doors doors were were


so proceed proceed with with your your statement

could could not not sleep sleep that that night vague vague feeling feeling of of impending impending
misfortune misfortune impressed impressed me sister sister and and you you will will recollect
were were twins and and you you know know how how subtle subtle are are the the which which bind bind two two
souls souls which which are are so so closely closely allied was was a a wild wild night wind wind
was was howling howling outside and and the the rain rain was was beating beating and and
against against the the windows amid amid all all the the hubbub hubbub of of the the gale
there there burst burst forth forth the the wild wild scream scream of of a a woman
that that it it was was my my sisters voice from from my my bed wrapped wrapped a a
shawl shawl round round me and and into into the the corridor opened opened my my door door
to to hear hear a a low low whistle such such as as my my sister sister described and and
a a few few moments moments later later a a sound as as if if a a mass mass of of metal metal had had
fallen down down the the passage my my sisters door door was was
and and slowly slowly upon upon its its at at it it
horrorstricken not not knowing knowing what what was was about about to to issue issue from from it
the the light light of of the the saw saw my my sister sister appear appear at at the the
opening her her face face blanched blanched with with terror her her hands hands groping groping for for
help her her whole whole figure figure swaying swaying to to and and fro fro like like that that of of a a
drunkard to to her her and and my my arms arms round round her but but at at that that
moment moment her her knees knees to to give give way way and and she she fell fell to to the the ground
as as one one who who is is in in terrible terrible pain and and her her limbs limbs were were
dreadfully dreadfully convulsed first first thought thought that that she she had had not not
me but but as as bent bent over over her her she she suddenly suddenly shrieked shrieked out out
in in a a voice voice which which shall shall never never forget my my was was
the the band speckled speckled band was was something something else else which which she she
would would fain fain have have said and and she she stabbed stabbed with with her her finger finger into into the the
air air in in the the direction direction of of the the doctors room but but a a fresh fresh convulsion convulsion
seized seized her her and and choked choked her her words out calling calling loudly loudly for for
my my stepfather and and met met him him hastening hastening from from his his room room in in his his
he he my my sisters side side she she was was
unconscious and and though though he he brandy brandy down down her her throat throat and and sent sent
for for medical medical aid aid from from the the village all all efforts efforts were were in in vain for for
she she slowly slowly and and without without having having her her
consciousness was was the the dreadful dreadful end end of of my my beloved beloved sister

moment said said are you you sure sure about about this this whistle whistle and and
metallic metallic sound you you swear swear to to it

was was what what the the county county coroner coroner asked asked me me at at the the inquiry is is
my my strong strong impression impression that that heard heard it and and yet among among the the crash crash of of
the the gale gale and and the the creaking creaking of of an an old old house may may possibly possibly have have
been been deceived

your your sister sister dressed

she she was was in in her her her her right right hand hand was was found found the the
stump stump of of a a match and and in in her her left left a a matchbox

that that she she had had struck struck a a light light and and about about her her when when
the the alarm alarm place is is important what what conclusions conclusions did did
the the coroner coroner come come to

the the case case with with great great care for for
conduct conduct had had long long been been notorious notorious in in the the county but but he he was was unable unable
to to find find any any satisfactory satisfactory cause cause of of death evidence evidence that that
the the door door had had been been fastened fastened upon upon the the inner inner side and and the the windows windows
were were blocked blocked by by old-fashioned oldfashioned with with broad broad iron iron bars
which which were were every every night walls walls were were carefully carefully
and and were were shown shown to to be be quite quite solid solid all all round and and the the flooring flooring was was
also also thoroughly thoroughly with with the the same same result chimney chimney is is
wide but but is is barred barred up up by by four four large large is is certain
therefore that that my my sister sister was was quite quite alone alone when when she she met met her her end
there there were were no no marks marks of of any any violence violence upon upon her

about about poison

doctors doctors her her for for it but but without without success

do do you you think think that that this this unfortunate unfortunate lady lady of then

is is my my belief belief that that she she of of pure pure fear fear and and nervous nervous shock
though though what what it it was was that that frightened frightened her her cannot cannot imagine

there there in in the the plantation plantation at at the the time

there there are are nearly nearly always always some some there

and and what what did did you you gather gather from from this this allusion allusion to to a a
speckled speckled band

have have thought thought that that it it was was merely merely the the wild wild talk talk of of
delirium sometimes sometimes that that it it may may have have to to some some band band of of
people perhaps perhaps to to these these very very in in the the plantation do do not not
know know whether whether the the spotted spotted which which so so many many of of them them wear wear
over over their their heads heads might might have have the the strange strange adjective adjective which which
she she used

shook shook his his head head like like a a man man who who is is far far from from being being satisfied

are are very very deep deep waters said said he pray go go on on with with your your
narrative

years years have have passed passed since since then and and my my life life has has been been until until
lately lately than than ever month month ago however a a dear dear friend
whom whom have have known known for for many many years has has done done me me the the to to ask ask
my my hand hand in in marriage name name is is
second second son son of of of of near near
stepfather stepfather has has offered offered no no opposition opposition to to the the match and and we we are are to to
be be married married in in the the course course of of the the spring days days ago ago some some
were were in in the the west west wing wing of of the the building and and my my bedroom bedroom
wall wall has has been been pierced so so that that have have had had to to move move into into the the
chamber chamber in in which which my my sister sister and and to to sleep sleep in in the the very very bed bed in in
which which she she then my my thrill thrill of of terror terror when when last last
night as as lay lay awake thinking thinking over over her her terrible terrible fate
suddenly suddenly heard heard in in the the silence silence of of the the night night the the low low whistle whistle which which
had had been been the the herald herald of of her her own own death up up and and the the
lamp but but nothing nothing was was to to be be seen seen in in the the room was was too too shaken shaken to to
go go to to bed bed again however so so dressed and and as as soon soon as as it it was was
daylight daylight down a a dogcart at at the the which which
is is opposite and and drove drove to to from from whence whence have have come come on on
this this morning morning with with the the one one object object of of seeing seeing you you and and asking asking your your
advice

have have done done wisely said said my my friend have have you you told told me me
all

all

you you have have not are are screening screening your your stepfather

what what do do you you mean

answer answer pushed pushed back back the the frill frill of of black black lace lace which which
fringed fringed the the hand hand that that lay lay upon upon our our knee little little
livid livid spots the the marks marks of of four four fingers fingers and and a a thumb were were printed printed
upon upon the the white white wrist

have have been been cruelly cruelly used said said

lady lady deeply deeply and and covered covered over over her her injured injured wrist
is is a a hard hard man she she said and perhaps perhaps he he hardly hardly knows knows his his own own
strength

was was a a long long silence during during which which leaned leaned his his chin chin
upon upon his his hands hands and and into into the the crackling crackling fire

is is a a very very deep deep business he he said said at at last are are a a
thousand thousand details details which which should should desire desire to to know know before before decide decide
upon upon our our course course of of action we we have have not not a a moment moment to to lose
we we were were to to come come to to today would would it it be be possible possible for for
us us to to see see over over these these rooms rooms without without the the knowledge knowledge of of your your
stepfather

it it happens he he spoke spoke of of coming coming into into town town today upon upon some some
most most important important business is is probable probable that that he he will will be be away away all all
day and and that that there there would would be be nothing nothing to to disturb disturb you have have a a
housekeeper housekeeper now but but she she is is old old and and foolish and and could could easily easily
get get her her out out of of the the way

are are not not averse averse to to this this trip

no no means

we we shall shall both both come are are you you going going to to do do yourself

have have one one or or two two things things which which would would wish wish to to do do now now that that am am
in in town shall shall return return by by the the twelve twelve o'clock oclock train so so as as to to
be be there there in in time time for for your your coming

you you may may expect expect us us early early in in the the afternoon have have myself myself some some
small small business business matters matters to to attend attend to you you not not wait wait and and
breakfast

must must go heart heart is is already already since since have have
my my trouble trouble to to you shall shall look look forward forward to to seeing seeing you you
again again this this afternoon dropped dropped her her thick thick black black veil veil over over her her
face face and and from from the the room

what what do do you you think think of of it it all asked asked
leaning leaning back back in in his his chair

seems seems to to me me to to be be a a most most dark dark and and sinister sinister business

enough enough and and sinister sinister enough

if if the the lady lady is is correct correct in in saying saying that that the the flooring flooring and and walls walls
are are sound and and that that the the door window and and chimney chimney are are impassable
then then her her sister sister must must have have been been undoubtedly undoubtedly alone alone when when she she met met her her
mysterious mysterious end

then of of these these nocturnal nocturnal and and what what of of the the
very very peculiar peculiar words words of of the the dying dying woman

cannot cannot think

you you combine combine the the ideas ideas of of at at night the the presence presence of of
a a band band of of who who are are on on intimate intimate terms terms with with this this old old doctor
the the fact fact that that we we have have every every reason reason to to believe believe that that the the doctor doctor has has
an an interest interest in in his his marriage the the dying dying
allusion allusion to to a a band and finally the the fact fact that that
heard heard a a metallic metallic clang which which might might have have been been caused caused by by one one of of
those those metal metal bars bars that that the the falling falling back back into into its its
place think think that that there there is is good good ground ground to to think think that that the the
mystery mystery may may be be cleared cleared along along those those lines

what then did did the the do

cannot cannot imagine

see see many many to to any any such such theory

so so do do is is precisely precisely for for that that reason reason that that we we are are going going
to to this this day want want to to see see whether whether the the are are
fatal or or if if they they may may be be away what what in in the the name name of of
the the devil

ejaculation ejaculation had had been been drawn drawn from from my my companion companion by by the the fact fact that that
our our door door had had been been suddenly suddenly dashed dashed open and and that that a a huge huge man man had had
framed framed himself himself in in the the aperture costume costume was was a a peculiar peculiar
mixture mixture of of the the professional professional and and of of the the agricultural having having a a
black black a a long long and and a a pair pair of of high high
with with a a swinging swinging in in his his hand tall tall was was he he that that his his
hat hat actually actually brushed brushed the the cross cross bar bar of of the the doorway and and his his
breadth breadth to to span span it it across across from from side side to to side large large face
seared seared with with a a thousand thousand burned burned yellow yellow with with the the sun and and
marked marked with with every every evil evil passion was was turned turned from from one one to to the the other other
of of us while while his his eyes and and his his high thin
nose him him somewhat somewhat the the resemblance resemblance to to a a fierce fierce old old
bird bird of of prey

of of you you is is asked asked this this apparition

name sir but but you you have have the the advantage advantage of of me said said my my
companion companion quietly

said said blandly take take a a seat

will will do do nothing nothing of of the the kind stepdaughter stepdaughter has has been been here
have have her has has she she been been saying saying to to you

is is a a little little cold cold for for the the time time of of the the year said said

has has she she been been saying saying to to you the the old old man man
furiously

have have heard heard that that the the promise promise well continued continued my my
companion companion

put put me me off do do you said said our our new new visitor taking taking a a step step
forward forward and and shaking shaking his his know know you you you scoundrel
have have heard heard of of you you before are are the the meddler

friend friend

the the busybody

smile smile

the the

heartily conversation conversation is is most most
entertaining said said he you you go go out out close close the the door for for
there there is is a a decided decided draught

will will go go when when have have said said my my say you you dare dare to to meddle meddle with with
my my affairs know know that that has has been been here her
am am a a dangerous dangerous man man to to fall fall foul foul of here
swiftly swiftly forward seized seized the the poker and and bent bent it it into into a a curve curve with with
his his huge huge brown brown hands

that that you you keep keep yourself yourself out out of of my my grip he he and and
hurling hurling the the twisted twisted poker poker into into the the fireplace fireplace he he out out of of the the
room

seems seems a a very very amiable amiable person said said laughing am am
not not quite quite so so bulky but but if if he he had had might might have have shown shown him him
that that my my grip grip was was not not much much more more feeble feeble than than his his own he he spoke spoke
he he picked picked up up the the steel steel poker poker and with with a a sudden sudden effort
straightened straightened it it out out again

his his having having the the insolence insolence to to confound confound me me with with the the official official
detective detective force incident incident zest zest to to our our investigation
however and and only only trust trust that that our our little little friend friend will will not not suffer suffer
from from her her imprudence imprudence in in this this brute brute to to trace trace her now
we we shall shall order order breakfast and and afterwards afterwards shall shall walk walk
down down to to where where hope hope to to get get some some data data which which may may
help help us us in in this this matter


was was nearly nearly one one o'clock oclock when when from from his his
excursion held held in in his his hand hand a a sheet sheet of of blue blue paper scrawled scrawled
over over with with notes notes and and

have have seen seen the the will will of of the the deceased deceased wife said said he
determine determine its its exact exact meaning meaning have have been been obliged obliged to to work work out out the the
present present prices prices of of the the investments investments with with which which it it is is concerned
total total income which which at at the the time time of of the the death death was was little little
short short of of pounds is is now through through the the fall fall in in agricultural agricultural
prices not not more more than than pounds daughter daughter can can claim claim an an
income income of of pounds in in case case of of marriage is is evident
therefore that that if if both both had had married this this beauty beauty would would have have
had had a a mere mere pittance while while even even one one of of them them would would cripple cripple him him to to
a a very very serious serious extent work work has has not not been been wasted
since since it it has has proved proved that that he he has has the the very very strongest strongest motives motives for for
standing standing in in the the way way of of anything anything of of the the sort now
this this is is too too serious serious for for dawdling especially especially as as the the old old man man is is
aware aware that that we we are are interesting interesting ourselves ourselves in in his his affairs so so if if you you
are are ready we we shall shall call call a a cab cab and and drive drive to to should should be be
very very much much obliged obliged if if you you would would slip slip your your revolver revolver into into your your
pocket is is an an excellent excellent argument argument with with gentlemen gentlemen
who who can can twist twist steel steel into into and and a a toothbrush
are think all all that that we we need

we we were were fortunate fortunate in in catching catching a a train train for for
where where we we hired hired a a trap trap at at the the station station inn inn and and drove drove
for for four four or or five five through through the the lovely lovely was was a a
perfect perfect day with with a a bright bright sun sun and and a a few few clouds clouds in in the the
heavens trees trees and and wayside wayside were were just just out out
their their first first green green and and the the air air was was full full of of the the pleasant pleasant
smell smell of of the the moist moist earth me me at at least least there there was was a a strange strange
contrast contrast between between the the sweet sweet promise promise of of the the spring spring and and this this
sinister sinister quest quest upon upon which which we we were were engaged companion companion sat sat in in
the the front front of of the the trap his his arms arms folded his his hat hat pulled pulled down down over over
his his eyes and and his his chin chin sunk sunk upon upon his his breast buried buried in in the the
deepest deepest thought however he he tapped tapped me me on on the the
shoulder and and pointed pointed over over the the

there said said he

heavily heavily timbered timbered park park stretched stretched up up in in a a gentle gentle slope
thickening thickening into into a a grove grove at at the the highest highest point amid amid the the
there there out out the the grey grey and and high high of of a a
very very old old mansion

said said he

sir that that be be the the house house of of
the the driver

some some distance distance to to the the left but if if you you want want to to get get to to the the
house you'll find find it it to to get get over over this this stile and and so so by by
the the footpath over over the the fields it it is where where the the lady lady is is
walking

the the lady fancy is is observed observed shading shading
his his eyes think think we we had had better better do do as as you you suggest

off paid paid our our fare and and the the trap trap back back on on its its way way
to to

thought thought it it as as well said said as as we we the the stile
that this this fellow fellow should should think think we we had had come come here here as as or or
on on some some definite definite business may may stop stop his his gossip
see see that that we we have have been been as as good good as as
our our word

client client of of the the morning morning had had hurried hurried forward forward to to meet meet us us with with a a
face face which which spoke spoke her her joy have have been been waiting waiting so so eagerly eagerly for for
you she she shaking shaking hands hands with with us us has has turned turned
out out has has gone gone to to town and and it it is is unlikely unlikely
that that he he will will be be back back before before evening

have have had had the the pleasure pleasure of of making making the the doctors acquaintance
said said and and in in a a few few words words he he out out what what had had
occurred turned turned white white to to the the lips lips as as she she listened

heavens she she he has has me then

your your at at we we must must make make the the best best use use of of our our
time so so kindly kindly take take us us at at once once to to the the rooms rooms which which we we are are to to
examine

building building was was of of grey stone with with a a high high
central central portion portion and and two two wings like like the the claws claws of of a a crab
thrown thrown out out on on each each side one one of of these these wings wings the the windows windows were were
broken broken and and blocked blocked with with wooden wooden boards while while the the roof roof was was partly partly
in a a picture picture of of ruin central central portion portion was was in in little little
better better repair but but the the right-hand righthand block block was was comparatively comparatively modern
and and the the blinds blinds in in the the windows with with the the blue blue smoke smoke curling curling up up
from from the the that that this this was was where where the the family family
scaffolding scaffolding had had been been erected erected against against the the end end wall and and the the
stonework had had been been broken broken into but but there there were were no no signs signs of of any any
at at the the moment moment of of our our visit walked walked slowly slowly up up and and
down down the the lawn lawn and and with with deep deep attention attention the the
of of the the windows

take take it to to the the room room in in which which you you used used to to sleep
the the centre centre one one to to your your sisters and and the the one one next next to to the the main main
building building to to chamber

so am am now now sleeping sleeping in in the the middle middle one

the the as as understand the the way there there does does
not not seem seem to to be be any any very very pressing pressing need need for for at at that that end end
wall

were were none believe believe that that it it was was an an excuse excuse to to move move me me from from
my my room

that that is is suggestive on on the the other other side side of of this this narrow narrow
wing wing runs runs the the corridor corridor from from which which these these three three rooms rooms open
are are windows windows in in it of of course

but but very very small small ones narrow narrow for for to to pass pass
through

you you both both your your doors doors at at night your your rooms rooms were were
unapproachable unapproachable from from that that side would would you you have have the the kindness kindness
to to go go into into your your room room and and bar bar your your

did did so and and after after a a careful careful examination examination
through through the the open open window in in every every way way to to force force the the
shutter shutter open but but without without success was was no no slit slit through through
which which a a knife knife could could be be passed passed to to raise raise the the bar with with his his
lens lens he he tested tested the the but but they they were were of of solid solid iron built built
firmly firmly into into the the massive massive masonry said said he scratching scratching his his
chin chin in in some some perplexity my theory theory certainly certainly presents presents some some
difficulties one one could could pass pass these these if if they they were were
we we shall shall see see if if the the inside inside any any light light upon upon
the the matter

small small side side door door led led into into the the whitewashed whitewashed corridor corridor from from which which
the the three three opened refused refused to to examine examine the the third third
chamber so so we we passed passed at at once once to to the the second that that in in which which
was was now now sleeping and and in in which which her her sister sister had had met met with with her her
fate was was a a homely homely little little room with with a a low low ceiling ceiling and and a a
gaping gaping fireplace after after the the fashion fashion of of old old
brown brown chest chest of of drawers drawers stood stood in in one one corner a a narrow narrow
bed bed in in another and and a a on on the the
side side of of the the window articles with with two two small small
made made up up all all the the furniture furniture in in the the room room save save
for for a a square square of of carpet carpet in in the the centre boards boards round round and and
the the of of the the walls walls were were of of brown wormeaten oak so so old old
and and that that it it may may have have dated dated from from the the original original building building
of of the the house one one of of the the into into a a corner corner and and sat sat
silent while while his his eyes eyes round round and and round round and and up up and and down
taking taking in in every every detail detail of of the the apartment

does does that that bell bell communicate communicate with he he asked asked at at last last
pointing pointing to to a a thick thick which which hung hung down down beside beside the the bed the the
tassel tassel actually actually lying lying upon upon the the pillow

goes goes to to the the room

looks looks than than the the other other things

it it was was only only put put there there a a couple couple of of years years ago

sister sister asked asked for for it suppose

never never heard heard of of her her using using it used used always always to to get get what what we we
wanted wanted for for ourselves

it it unnecessary unnecessary to to put put so so nice nice a a bellpull there
will will excuse excuse me me for for a a few few minutes minutes while while satisfy satisfy myself myself as as to to
this this floor himself himself down down upon upon his his face face with with his his lens lens in in
his his hand hand and and swiftly swiftly backward backward and and forward
minutely minutely the the cracks cracks between between the the boards he he did did the the same same with with
the the woodwork with with which which the the chamber chamber was was he he
walked walked over over to to the the bed bed and and spent spent some some time time in in staring staring at at it it and and
in in running running his his eye eye up up and and down down the the wall he he the the
in in his his hand hand and and it it a a brisk brisk tug

its a a dummy said said he

it it ring

it it is is not not even even attached attached to to a a wire is is very very interesting
can can see see now now that that it it is is fastened fastened to to a a hook hook just just above above where where
the the little little opening opening for for the the ventilator ventilator is

very very absurd never never noticed noticed that that before

strange pulling pulling at at the the rope are are
one one or or two two very very singular singular points points about about this this room example
what what a a fool fool a a builder builder must must be be to to open open a a ventilator ventilator into into another another
room when with with the the same same trouble he he might might have have communicated communicated
with with the the outside outside air

is is also also quite quite modern said said the the lady

about about the the same same time time as as the the

there there were were several several little little changes changes carried carried out out about about that that
time

seem seem to to have have been been of of a a most most interesting interesting
and and which which do do not not ventilate your your
permission we we shall shall now now carry carry our our into into
the the inner inner apartment

chamber chamber was was larger larger than than that that of of his his
stepdaughter but but was was as as plainly plainly furnished a a small small
wooden wooden shelf shelf full full of of books of of a a technical technical character an an
armchair armchair beside beside the the bed a a plain plain wooden wooden chair chair against against the the wall a a
round round table and and a a large large iron iron safe safe were were the the principal principal things things
which which met met the the eye walked walked slowly slowly round round and and each each
and and all all of of them them with with the the interest

in in here he he asked tapping tapping the the safe

business business papers

you you have have seen seen inside then

once some some years years ago remember remember that that it it was was full full of of
papers

isn't a a cat cat in in it for for example

a a strange strange idea

look look at at this up up a a small small saucer saucer of of milk milk which which
stood stood on on the the top top of of it

we we don't dont keep keep a a cat there there is is a a cheetah cheetah and and a a baboon

yes of of course a a cheetah cheetah is is just just a a big big cat and and yet yet a a
saucer saucer of of milk milk does does not not go go very very far far in in its its wants
is is one one point point which which should should wish wish to to determine
down down in in front front of of the the wooden wooden chair chair and and the the seat seat
of of it it with with the the greatest greatest attention

you is is quite quite settled said said he rising rising and and putting putting
his his lens lens in in his his pocket is is something something interesting

object object which which had had caught caught his his eye eye was was a a small small dog dog lash lash hung hung on on
one one corner corner of of the the bed lash however was was curled curled upon upon itself itself
and and tied tied so so as as to to make make a a loop loop of of whipcord

do do you you make make of of that

a a common common enough enough lash don't dont know know why why it it should should be be
tied

is is not not quite quite so so common is is it me its a a wicked wicked world
and and when when a a clever clever man man turns turns his his brains brains to to crime crime it it is is the the worst worst
of of all think think that that have have seen seen enough enough now and and
with with your your permission permission we we shall shall walk walk out out upon upon the the lawn

had had never never seen seen my my friends face face so so grim grim or or his his brow brow so so dark dark as as
it it was was when when we we turned turned from from the the scene scene of of this this investigation
had had walked walked several several times times up up and and down down the the lawn neither neither
nor nor myself myself liking liking to to break break in in upon upon his his thoughts thoughts before before he he
himself himself from from his his reverie

is is very very essential said said he that you you should should
absolutely absolutely follow follow my my advice advice in in every every respect

shall shall most most certainly certainly do do so

matter matter is is too too serious serious for for any any hesitation life life may may
depend depend upon upon your your compliance

assure assure you you that that am am in in your your hands

the the first first place both both my my friend friend and and must must spend spend the the night night in in
your your room

and and at at him him in in astonishment

it it must must be be so me me explain believe believe that that that that is is the the
village village inn inn over over there

that that is is the the

good windows windows would would be be visible visible from from there



must must confine confine yourself yourself to to your your room on on of of a a
headache when when your your stepfather stepfather comes comes back when when you you hear hear him him
retire retire for for the the night you you must must open open the the of of your your window

withdraw withdraw quietly quietly with with everything everything which which you you are are likely likely to to want want
into into the the room room which which you you used used to to occupy have have no no doubt doubt that in in
spite spite of of the the you you could could manage manage there there for for one one night

yes easily

rest rest you you will will leave leave in in our our hands

what what will will you you do

shall shall spend spend the the night night in in your your room and and we we shall shall investigate investigate
the the cause cause of of this this noise noise which which has has disturbed disturbed you

believe that that you you have have already already made made up up your your mind
said said laying laying her her hand hand upon upon my my sleeve

have

for for pitys sake tell tell me me what what was was the the cause cause of of my my sisters
death

should should prefer prefer to to have have before before speak

can can at at least least tell tell me me whether whether my my own own thought thought is is correct and and
if if she she from from some some sudden sudden fright

do do not not think think so think think that that there there was was probably probably some some more more
tangible tangible cause now we we must must leave leave you you for for if if
and and saw saw us us our our journey journey would would be be in in vain
and and be be brave for for if if you you will will do do what what have have told told you
you you may may rest rest assured assured that that we we shall shall soon soon drive drive away away the the
that that threaten threaten you

and and had had no no difficulty difficulty in in engaging engaging a a bedroom bedroom and and
at at the the were were on on the the upper upper floor and and
from from our our window window we we could could command command a a view view of of the the avenue avenue gate and and
of of the the inhabited inhabited wing wing of of dusk dusk we we saw saw
drive drive past his his huge huge form form looming looming up up beside beside
the the little little figure figure of of the the lad lad who who drove drove him boy boy had had some some
slight slight difficulty difficulty in in undoing undoing the the heavy heavy iron iron gates and and we we heard heard
the the hoarse hoarse roar roar of of the the doctors voice voice and and saw saw the the fury fury with with which which
he he shook shook his his at at him trap trap drove drove on and and a a few few
minutes minutes later later we we saw saw a a sudden sudden light light spring spring up up among among the the trees trees as as
the the lamp lamp was was in in one one of of the the

you you know said said as as we we sat sat together together in in the the
gathering gathering darkness have have really really some some as as to to taking taking you you
tonight is is a a distinct distinct element element of of danger

be be of of assistance

presence presence might might be be invaluable

shall shall certainly certainly come

is is very very kind kind of of you

speak speak of of danger have have seen seen more more in in these these rooms rooms
than than was was visible visible to to me

but but fancy fancy that that may may have have a a little little more imagine imagine
that that you you saw saw all all that that did

saw saw nothing nothing remarkable remarkable save save the the and and what what purpose purpose
that that could could answer answer confess confess is is more more than than can can imagine

saw saw the the ventilator too

but but do do not not think think that that it it is is such such a a very very unusual unusual thing thing to to
have have a a small small opening opening between between two two rooms was was so so small small that that a a
rat rat could could hardly hardly pass pass through

that that we we should should find find a a ventilator ventilator before before ever ever we we came came to to


dear dear

yes did remember remember in in her her statement statement she she said said that that her her
sister sister could could smell smell cigar of of course course that that
at at once once that that there there must must be be a a communication communication between between the the
two two rooms could could only only be be a a small small one or or it it would would have have been been
upon upon at at the the inquiry a a ventilator

what what harm harm can can there there be be in in that

there there is is at at least least a a curious curious coincidence coincidence of of
ventilator ventilator is is made a a cord cord is is hung and and a a lady lady who who in in the the
bed bed dies not not that that strike strike you

cannot cannot as as yet yet see see any any connection

you you observe observe anything anything very very peculiar peculiar about about that that bed



was was to to the the floor you you ever ever see see a a bed bed fastened fastened
like like that that before

cannot cannot say say that that have

lady lady could could not not move move her her bed must must always always be be in in the the same same
relative relative position position to to the the ventilator ventilator and and to to the the so so we we may may
call call it since since it it was was clearly clearly never never meant meant for for a a bellpull

seem seem to to see see dimly dimly what what you you are are at
are are only only just just in in time time to to prevent prevent some some subtle subtle and and horrible horrible
crime

enough enough and and horrible horrible enough a a doctor doctor does does go go wrong wrong
he he is is the the first first of of has has nerve nerve and and he he has has knowledge
and and were were among among the the heads heads of of their their profession
man man strikes strikes even even but but think that that we we shall shall
be be able able to to strike strike still we we shall shall have have horrors horrors enough enough
before before the the night night is is over for for goodness sake sake let let us us have have a a quiet quiet
pipe pipe and and turn turn our our minds minds for for a a few few hours hours to to something something more more
cheerful


nine nine o'clock oclock the the light light among among the the trees trees was was extinguished
and and all all was was dark dark in in the the direction direction of of the the hours hours
passed passed slowly slowly away and and then suddenly just just at at the the stroke stroke of of
eleven a a single single bright bright light light out out right right in in front front of of us

is is our our signal said said springing springing to to his his feet it
comes comes from from the the middle middle window

we we passed passed out out he he exchanged exchanged a a few few words words with with the the landlord
that that we we were were going going on on a a late late visit visit to to an an acquaintance
and and that that it it was was possible possible that that we we might might spend spend the the night night there
moment moment later later we we were were out out on on the the dark dark road a a chill chill wind wind blowing blowing
in in our our faces and and one one yellow yellow light light twinkling twinkling in in front front of of us us
through through the the gloom gloom to to guide guide us us on on our our errand

was was little little difficulty difficulty in in entering entering the the grounds for for
unrepaired unrepaired in in the the old old park park wall our our way way
among among the the trees we we the the lawn crossed crossed it and and were were about about
to to enter enter through through the the window window when when out out from from a a clump clump of of laurel laurel
bushes bushes there there what what to to be be a a hideous hideous and and distorted distorted
child who who itself itself upon upon the the grass grass with with limbs limbs and and
then then swiftly swiftly across across the the lawn lawn into into the the darkness

whispered did you you see see it

was was for for the the moment moment as as startled startled as as hand hand closed closed like like
a a vice vice upon upon my my wrist wrist in in his his agitation he he broke broke into into a a low low
laugh laugh and and put put his his lips lips to to my my ear

is is a a nice nice household he he is is the the baboon

had had forgotten forgotten the the strange strange which which the the doctor doctor affected
was was a a cheetah too perhaps perhaps we we might might find find it it upon upon our our shoulders shoulders
at at any any moment confess confess that that felt felt easier easier in in my my mind mind when
after after following following example example and and slipping slipping off off my my shoes
found found myself myself inside inside the the bedroom companion companion noiselessly noiselessly closed closed
the the moved moved the the lamp lamp the the table and and cast cast his his eyes eyes
round round the the room was was as as we we had had seen seen it it in in the the daytime
creeping creeping up up to to me me and and making making a a trumpet trumpet of of his his hand he he whispered whispered
into into my my ear ear again again so so gently gently that that it it was was all all that that could could do do to to
distinguish distinguish the the words

least least sound sound would would be be fatal fatal to to our our

to to show show that that had had heard

must must sit sit without without light would would see see it it through through the the
ventilator

again

not not go go asleep your your very very life life may may depend depend upon upon it your your
pistol pistol ready ready in in case case we we should should need need it will will sit sit on on the the side side of of
the the bed and and you you in in that that chair

out out my my revolver revolver and and laid laid it it on on the the corner corner of of the the table

had had brought brought up up a a long long thin thin cane and and this this he he placed placed upon upon
the the bed bed beside beside him it it he he laid laid the the box box of of and and the the
stump stump of of a a candle he he turned turned down down the the lamp and and we we were were left left
in in darkness

shall shall ever ever forget forget that that dreadful dreadful vigil could could not not hear hear a a
sound not not even even the the drawing drawing of of a a breath and and yet yet that that my my
companion companion sat sat openeyed within within a a few few feet feet of of me in in the the same same
state state of of nervous nervous tension tension in in which which was was myself cut cut
off off the the least least ray ray of of light and and we we in in absolute absolute darkness

outside outside came came the the occasional occasional cry cry of of a a and and once once at at
our our very very window window a a long long drawn drawn catlike catlike whine which which told told us us that that
the the cheetah cheetah was was indeed indeed at at liberty away away we we could could hear hear the the
deep deep of of the the parish parish clock which which out out every every quarter quarter of of
an an hour long long they they those those quarters struck and and
one one and and two two and and three and and still still we we sat sat waiting waiting silently silently for for
whatever whatever might might befall

there there was was the the momentary momentary gleam gleam of of a a light light up up in in the the
direction direction of of the the ventilator which which vanished vanished immediately but but was was
by by a a strong strong smell smell of of burning burning oil oil and and heated heated metal
in in the the next next room room had had a a heard heard a a gentle gentle
sound sound of of movement and and then then all all was was silent silent once once more though though the the
smell smell stronger half half an an hour hour sat sat with with ears
suddenly suddenly another another sound sound became became very very gentle
soothing soothing sound like like that that of of a a small small jet jet of of steam steam
continually continually from from a a kettle instant instant that that we we heard heard it
from from the the bed struck struck a a match and and furiously furiously with with
his his cane cane at at the the bellpull

see see it he he see see it

saw saw nothing the the moment moment when when struck struck the the light light
heard heard a a low clear clear whistle but but the the sudden sudden glare glare flashing flashing into into my my
weary weary eyes eyes made made it it impossible impossible for for me me to to tell tell what what it it was was at at which which
my my friend friend so so savagely could however see see that that his his face face
was was deadly deadly pale pale and and filled filled with with horror horror and and loathing had had
to to strike strike and and was was gazing gazing up up at at the the ventilator ventilator when when
suddenly suddenly there there broke broke from from the the silence silence of of the the night night the the most most
horrible horrible cry cry to to which which have have ever ever listened up up louder louder
and and louder a a hoarse hoarse yell yell of of pain pain and and fear fear and and anger anger all all mingled mingled
in in the the one one dreadful dreadful shriek say say that that away away down down in in the the
village and and even even in in the the distant distant parsonage that that cry cry raised raised the the
sleepers sleepers from from their their struck struck cold cold to to our our hearts and and
stood stood gazing gazing at at and and he he at at me until until the the last last echoes echoes of of it it
had had away away into into the the silence silence from from which which it it rose

can can it it mean

means means that that it it is is all all over perhaps
after after all it it is is for for the the best your your pistol and and we we will will
enter enter room

a a grave grave face face he he the the lamp lamp and and led led the the way way down down the the
corridor he he struck struck at at the the chamber chamber door door without without any any reply reply
from from within he he turned turned the the handle handle and and entered at at his his
heels with with the the pistol pistol in in my my hand

was was a a singular singular sight sight which which met met our our eyes the the table table stood stood a a
with with the the shutter shutter half half open a a brilliant brilliant
beam beam of of light light upon upon the the iron iron safe the the door door of of which which was was ajar
this this table on on the the wooden wooden chair sat sat
clad clad in in a a long long grey grey his his bare bare
beneath and and his his feet feet thrust thrust into into red red slippers
his his lap lap lay lay the the short short stock stock with with the the long long lash lash which which we we
had had noticed noticed during during the the day chin chin was was upward upward and and his his
eyes eyes were were fixed fixed in in a a dreadful rigid rigid stare stare at at the the corner corner of of the the
ceiling his his brow brow he he had had a a peculiar peculiar yellow yellow band with with
which which to to be be bound bound tightly tightly round round his his
head we we entered entered he he made made neither neither sound sound nor nor motion

band the the speckled speckled band whispered whispered

a a step step forward an an instant instant his his strange strange headgear headgear
to to move and and there there itself itself from from among among his his hair hair the the squat squat
head head and and puffed puffed neck neck of of a a loathsome loathsome serpent

is is a a swamp swamp adder the snake snake in in
has has within within ten ten of of being being bitten
does in in truth recoil recoil upon upon the the violent and and the the schemer schemer falls falls
into into the the pit pit which which he he for for another us us thrust thrust this this
creature creature back back into into its its den and and we we can can then then remove remove to to
some some place place of of shelter shelter and and let let the the county county police police know know what what has has


he he spoke spoke he he the the swiftly swiftly from from the the dead dead mans lap
and and the the noose noose round round the the neck neck he he it it from from
its its horrid horrid perch perch and carrying carrying it it at at arms length it it into into
the the iron iron safe which which he he closed closed upon upon it

are are the the true true facts facts of of the the death death of of of of
is is not not necessary necessary that that should should prolong prolong a a
narrative narrative which which has has already already run run to to too too great great a a length length by by telling telling
how how we we broke broke the the sad sad news news to to the the girl how how we we conveyed conveyed
her her by by the the morning morning train train to to the the care care of of her her good good aunt aunt at at
of of how how the the slow slow process process of of official official inquiry inquiry came came to to the the
conclusion conclusion that that the the doctor doctor met met his his fate fate while while indiscreetly indiscreetly
playing playing with with a a dangerous dangerous pet little little which which had had yet yet to to learn learn
of of the the case case was was told told me me by by as as we we back back
next next day

had said said he come to to an an entirely entirely erroneous erroneous conclusion conclusion which which
my my dear dear how how dangerous dangerous it it always always is is to to reason reason from from
insufficient insufficient data presence presence of of the the and and the the use use of of
the the word word band which which was was used used by by the the poor poor girl no no doubt to to
explain explain the the appearance appearance which which she she had had caught caught a a hurried hurried glimpse glimpse of of
by by the the light light of of her her match were were sufficient sufficient to to put put me me upon upon an an
entirely entirely wrong wrong scent can can only only claim claim the the merit merit that that
my my position position when however it it became became clear clear to to me me
that that whatever whatever danger danger threatened threatened an an occupant occupant of of the the room room could could not not
come come either either from from the the window window or or the the door attention attention was was
speedily speedily drawn as as have have already already to to you to to this this
ventilator and and to to the the which which hung hung down down to to the the bed
discovery discovery that that this this was was a a dummy and and that that the the bed bed was was to to
the the floor rise rise to to the the suspicion suspicion that that the the rope rope was was
there there as as a a bridge bridge for for something something passing passing through through the the hole hole and and
coming coming to to the the bed idea idea of of a a snake snake occurred occurred to to me
and and when when coupled coupled it it with with my my knowledge knowledge that that the the doctor doctor was was
furnished furnished with with a a supply supply of of from from felt felt that that
was was probably probably on on the the right right track idea idea of of using using a a form form of of
poison poison which which could could not not possibly possibly be be discovered discovered by by any any chemical chemical
test test was was just just such such a a one one as as would would occur occur to to a a clever clever and and ruthless ruthless
man man who who had had had had an an training rapidity rapidity with with which which such such
a a poison poison would would take take effect effect would would also from from his his point point of of view be be
an an advantage would would be be a a sharp-eyed coroner indeed who who could could
distinguish distinguish the the two two little little dark dark which which would would show show where where
the the poison poison fangs fangs had had done done their their work thought thought of of the the
whistle course course he he must must recall recall the the snake snake before before the the morning morning
light light revealed revealed it it to to the the victim had had trained trained it probably probably by by
the the use use of of the the milk milk which which we we saw to to return return to to him him when when
would would put put it it through through this this ventilator ventilator at at the the hour hour that that he he
thought thought best with with the the certainty certainty that that it it would would crawl crawl down down the the
rope rope and and land land on on the the bed might might or or might might not not bite bite the the
occupant perhaps perhaps she she might might escape escape every every night night for for a a week but but
sooner sooner or or later later she she must must fall fall a a victim

had had come come to to these these conclusions conclusions before before ever ever had had entered entered his his
room inspection inspection of of his his chair chair me me that that he he had had been been in in
the the habit habit of of standing standing on on it which which of of course course would would be be necessary necessary
in in order order that that he he should should reach reach the the ventilator sight sight of of the the
safe the the saucer saucer of of milk and and the the loop loop of of whipcord whipcord were were enough enough to to
finally finally dispel dispel any any doubts doubts which which may may have have metallic metallic
clang clang heard heard by by was was obviously obviously caused caused by by her her stepfather stepfather
hastily hastily closing closing the the door door of of his his safe safe upon upon its its terrible terrible occupant
once once made made up up my my mind you you know know the the steps steps which which in in
order order to to put put the the matter matter to to the the proof heard heard the the creature creature hiss hiss
as as have have no no doubt doubt that that you you did did also and and the the
light light and and it

the the result result of of driving driving it it through through the the ventilator

also also with with the the result result of of causing causing it it to to turn turn upon upon its its master master
at at the the other other side of of the the blows blows of of my my cane cane came came home home and and
its its temper so so that that it it upon upon the the first first person person
it it saw this this way way am am no no doubt doubt indirectly indirectly responsible responsible for for
death and and cannot cannot say say that that it it is is likely likely to to
weigh weigh very very heavily heavily upon upon my my conscience





all all the the which which have have been been to to my my friend
for for solution solution during during the the years years of of our our intimacy
there there were were only only two two which which was was the the means means of of to to his his
of of thumb and and that that of of
madness these these the the latter latter may may have have a a
finer finer field field for for an an acute acute and and original original observer but but the the other other was was
so so strange strange in in its its inception inception and and so so dramatic dramatic in in its its details details that that
it it may may be be the the more more worthy worthy of of being being placed placed upon upon record even even if if it it
my my friend friend fewer fewer for for those those deductive deductive of of
reasoning reasoning by by which which he he such such remarkable remarkable results story story
has believe been been told told more more than than once once in in the the newspapers but
like like all all such such its its effect effect is is much much less less striking striking when when
set set forth forth en en bloc bloc in in a a single single of of print print than than when when the the
facts facts slowly slowly evolve evolve before before your your own own eyes and and the the mystery mystery
gradually gradually away away as as each each new new discovery discovery a a step step which which leads leads
on on to to the the complete complete truth the the time time the the circumstances circumstances made made a a
deep deep impression impression upon upon me and and the the lapse lapse of of two two years years has has hardly hardly
served served to to weaken weaken the the effect

was was in in the the summer summer of of not not long long after after my my marriage that that the the
events events occurred occurred which which am am now now about about to to had had
to to civil civil practice practice and and had had finally finally abandoned abandoned in in his his
rooms although although continually continually him him and and occasionally occasionally
even even persuaded persuaded him him to to his his habits habits so so far far as as to to come come
and and visit visit us practice practice had had steadily steadily increased and and as as
to to live live at at no no very very great great distance distance from from
a a few few from from among among the the of of
these whom whom had had cured cured of of a a painful painful and and lingering lingering disease was was
never never weary weary of of advertising advertising my my virtues virtues and and of of to to send send
me me on on every every sufferer sufferer over over whom whom he he might might have have any any influence

morning at at a a little little before before seven seven oclock was was awakened awakened by by
the the maid maid tapping tapping at at the the door door to to announce announce that that two two men men had had come come
from from and and were were waiting waiting in in the the
dressed dressed hurriedly for for by by experience experience that that railway railway

soft soft cloth cloth cap cap which which he he had had laid laid down down upon upon my my books one one of of
his his hands hands he he had had a a handkerchief handkerchief wrapped which which was was mottled mottled all all
over over with with was was young not not more more than than
should should say with with a a strong masculine masculine face but but
he he was was exceedingly exceedingly pale pale and and me me the the impression impression of of a a man man who who
was was suffering suffering from from some some strong strong agitation which which it it all all his his
strength strength of of mind mind to to control

leaning leaning back back in in his his chair chair and and shaking shaking his his sides my my medical medical
rose rose up up against against that that laugh
